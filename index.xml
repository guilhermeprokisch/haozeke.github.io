      <description>Background  I have had a lot of discussions regarding the teaching of git This is mostly as a part of the SoftwareCarpentries, or in view of my involvement with univ.ai, or simply in every public space I am associated with Without getting into my views, I just wanted to keep this resource in mind  The site  Learning git is a highly contentious thing People seem to be fond of GUI tools, especially since on non *nix systems, it seems that there is a lot of debate surrounding obtaining the git utility in the first place  One of the best ways of understanding (without installing stuff) the mental models required for working with git is this site</description>

      <title>Provisioning Dotfiles on an HPC</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</link>

      <description>Background My dotfiles turned 4 years old a few months ago (since 9th Jan 2017) and remains one of my most frequently updated projects for obvious reasons. Going through the changes reminds me of a whole of posts I never got around to writing.
Anyway, recently I gained access to another HPC cluster, with a standard configuration (bash, old CentOS) and decided to track my provisioning steps. This is really a very streamlined experience by now, since I&amp;rsquo;ve used the same setup across scores of machines.</description>

      <title>Switching to Colemak</title>

      <description>Background I just realized that it has been over two years since I switched from QWERTY to COLEMAK but somehow never managed to write about it. It was a major change in my life, and it took forever to get acclimatized to. I do not think I&amp;rsquo;ll ever again be in a position to make such a change in my life again, but it was definitely worth it.
Touch Typing My interest in touch typing in I decided to digitize my notes for posterity, during the last two years of my undergraduate studies back in Harcourt Butler Technical Institute (HBTI) Kanpur, India.</description>

      <title>Bojack Horseman</title>

      <description>Background For a while I was worried about writing about a TV show here. I thought it might be frivolous, or worse, might outweigh the other kinds of articles I would like to write. However, like most things, that which is ignored just grows, so it is easier to just write and forget about it.
The Show Much has been said about how Bojack Horseman is one of the best shows ever, and they&amp;rsquo;re all correct.</description>

      <title>Pandora and Proxychains</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pandora-proxychains/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pandora-proxychains/</guid>
      <description>Background  Pandora doesn&amp;rsquo;t work outside the states I keep forgetting how to set-up proxychains  Proxychains Technically this article expects proxychains-ng, which seems to be the more up-to-date fork of the original proxychains.
 Install proxychains-ng
# I am on archlinux.. sudo pacman -S proxychains-ng Copy the configuration to the $HOME directory
cp /etc/proxychains.conf . Edit said configuration to add some US-based proxy
  In my particular case, I don&amp;rsquo;t keep the tor section enabled.</description>

      <title>Replacing Jupyter with Orgmode</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode/</guid>
      <description>Background  I dislike Jupyter notebooks (and JupyterHub) a lot EIN is really not much of a solution either  In the past I have written some posts on TeX with JupyterHub and discussed ways to use virtual Python with JupyterHub in a more reasonable manner.
However, I personally found that EIN was a huge pain to work with, and I mostly ended up working with the web-interface anyway.</description>
