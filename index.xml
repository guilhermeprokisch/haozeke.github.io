      <description>Chapter VI - Linear Model Selection and Regularization All the questions are as per the ISL seventh printing1.
Common Instead of using the standard functions, we will leverage the mlr3 package2.

Load ISLR and other libraries.

Common Stuff Here I&amp;rsquo;ll load things I will be using throughout, mostly libraries.

      <title>Pandora and Proxychains</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pandora-proxychains/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pandora-proxychains/</guid>
      <description>Background  Pandora doesn&amp;rsquo;t work outside the states I keep forgetting how to set-up proxychains  Proxychains Technically this article expects proxychains-ng, which seems to be the more up-to-date fork of the original proxychains.
 Install proxychains-ng
# I am on archlinux.. sudo pacman -S proxychains-ng Copy the configuration to the $HOME directory
cp /etc/proxychains.conf . Edit said configuration to add some US-based proxy
  In my particular case, I don&amp;rsquo;t keep the tor section enabled.</description>

      <title>Replacing Jupyter with Orgmode</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode/</guid>
      <description>Background  I dislike Jupyter notebooks (and JupyterHub) a lot EIN is really not much of a solution either  In the past I have written some posts on TeX with JupyterHub and discussed ways to use virtual Python with JupyterHub in a more reasonable manner.
However, I personally found that EIN was a huge pain to work with, and I mostly ended up working with the web-interface anyway.</description>

      <title>Poetry and Direnv</title>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/poetry-direnv/</guid>
      <description>Background  I end up writing about using poetry a lot I almost always use direnv in real life too I don&amp;rsquo;t keep writing mini scripts in my .envrc  Honestly there&amp;rsquo;s nothing here anyone using the direnv wiki will find surprising, but then it is still neat to link back to.
Setting Up Poetry This essentially works by simply modifying the global .direnvrc which essentially gets sourced by every local .</description>

      <title>Taming Github Notifications</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/</guid>
      <description>Background As a member of several large organizations, I get a lot of github notifications. Not all of these are of relevance to me. This is especially true of psuedo-monorepo style repositories like the JOSS review system and especially the exercism community.
 I recently (re-)joined the exercism community as a maintainer for the C++ lessons after having been a (sporadic) teacher This was largely in response to a community call to action as the group needed new blood to usher in v3 of the exercism project  Anyway, I have since found that at the small cost of possibly much of my public repo data, I can manage my notifications better with Octobox</description>

      <title>Site Rationale</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rationale/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rationale/</guid>
      <description> Why this site exists I have a lot of online presences. I have been around (or at-least, lurking) for over ten years. Almost as long as I have been programming. Anyway, I have a penchant lately for using emacs and honestly there isn&amp;rsquo;t very good support for org-mode files. There are options recently with gatsby as well, but this seemed kinda neat.
What &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; is  This site is built by Hugo The posts are generated with ox-hugo The theme is based of this excellent one and my modifications are here  What is here  Mostly random thoughts I don&amp;rsquo;t mind people knowing Some tech stuff which isn&amp;rsquo;t coherent enough to be put in any form with references Emacs specific workflows which I might want to write about more than short notes on the config  What isn&amp;rsquo;t here  More coherent thoughts will not be here, that should and will go to my grimoire My doom-emacs configuration Academic stuff is better tracked on Publons or Google Scholar or my pages hosted by my favorite IITK group or UI group  </description>

      <description>Chapter II - Statistical Learning All the questions are as per the ISL seventh printing&amp;nbsp;1.
Question 2.8 - Pages 54-55 This exercise relates to the College data set, which can be found in the file College.csv. It contains a number of variables for \(777\) different universities and colleges in the US. The variables are
 Private : Public/private indicator Apps : Number of applications received Accept : Number of applicants accepted Enroll : Number of new students enrolled Top10perc : New students from top 10 % of high school class Top25perc : New students from top 25 % of high school class F.</description>

      <description>Hi.
I&amp;rsquo;m Rohit Goswami, better known across the web as HaoZeke. I&amp;rsquo;m not the first of my name, which is why instead of rgoswami, I occasionally use rg0swami when I need to be identified by something closer to my name.
The actual username is a throwback to back when people liked being anonymous (and with multiple personalities) online, so that ought to give an idea of how old I am.</description>
