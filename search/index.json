I have also spent a lot of time on Zoom, sharing my screen. Fun fact. My screen shares look like this:\n  Figure 1: Zoom screen share with weird overlay\n  This post is about hunting down what caused this amazing zoom glitch1 and how I finally fixed it.\nTiling Windows and Compositors For reasons best left to another post, I use the fabulous i3 window manager, with colemak keybindings described here. Recall that, from Wikipedia:\n A compositing window manager is a window manager that provides applications with an off-screen buffer for each window. The window manager composites the window buffers into an image representing the screen and writes the result into the display memory.\n For reasons I can no longer recall, compton has been a tradition aspect of my workflow. As per my last update back in April last year; my configuration is here.\nCompton to Picom Some time ago (actually many months ago), compton itself transitioned over to picom, but remained largely compatible with my old configuration2. To be clear, the transition was largely painless, with ample warnings in the terminal showing up; along with very reasonable fallbacks. The key aspect of my compton.conf which caused the shadowing was:\nshadow = true; shadow-radius = 5; shadow-offset-x = -5; shadow-offset-y = -5; shadow-opacity = 0.5; The corrective measure was simply to set shadow-opacity to nothing; that is:\nshadow-opacity = 0.0; The rest of the configuration is here; and contains a lot more, mostly pertaining to opacity and other pretty effects3.\nConclusion Finally we have achieved the goal of having normal screen sharing capabilities; as seen below:\n  Figure 2: Just in time to see an excellent pun\n  The struggle was real, though the cause was trivial, and really highlights the need to always know your system packages. In this case, no doubt my students would have preferred not having to suffer through the darkness of my screen4. This has been a rather trivial post, but one to keep in mind none-the-less.\n To be clear, none of the windows were the glitch. The issue was the darkened overlay [return] As always, the ArchLinux Wiki is a great place for more information [return] The rest of my Dotfiles, managed by the excellent dotgit are also worth a look [return] Though it might have also served as a metaphor for darkness [return]   ","permalink":"https://rgoswami.me/posts/compton-zoom-shadow/","tags":["workflow","tools"],"title":"Compton to Picom and Zoom Glitches"},{"categories":["notes"],"contents":" Background One of the main reasons to use orgmode is definitely to get a better note taking workflow. Closely related to blogging or writing, the ideal note workflow is one which lets you keep a bunch of throwaway ideas and also somehow have access to them in a coherent manner. This will be a long post, and it is a work-in-progress, so, keep that in mind. Since this is mainly me1 work-shopping my technique, the philosophy will come in a later post probably. This workflow is documented more sparsely in my config file here, in the noteYoda section2. Some parts of this post also include mini video clips for clarity3.\nThe entire workflow will end up being something like this4:\n  Concept While working through ideas, it actually was more useful to describe the workflow I want, and then implement it, instead of relying on the canned approaches of each package. So the basics of the ideology are listed below.\nReference Management Reference management is one of the main reasons to consider a plain-text setup, and mine is no different. The options most commonly seen are:\n Mendeley This is a great option, and the most mobile friendly of the bunch. Sadly, the price tiers aren\u0026rsquo;t very friendly so I have to give it a hard pass. Jabref This is fun, but really more of a per-project management system, but it works well for that. The fact that it is Java based was a major issue for me. Zotero This is what I personally use and recommend. More on that in a later post.  Notes The idea is to be able to create notes for all kinds of content. Specifically, papers or books, along with webpages. This then requires a separate system for each which is described by:\n Search Engine The search engine is key, both in terms of accessibility and scalability. It is assumed that there will be many notes, and that they will have a wide variety of content. The search interface must then simply allow us to narrow down our candidates in a meaningful manner. Contextual Representation This aspect of the workflow deals with representations, which should transcend the usage of tags or categories. In particular, it would be nice to be able to visualize the flow of ideas, each represented by a note. Backlinks In particular, by backlinks at this point we are referring to the ability to link to a pdf or a website with a unique key such that notes can be added or removed at will. Storage Not actually part of the workflow in the same way, since it will be handled at the system level, it is worth nothing, that in this workflow Zotero is used to export a master bib file and keeps it updated, while the notes themselves are version controlled5.  The concepts above will be handled by the following packages.\n   Concept Package Note     Search deft Has a great interface   Context org-roam Allows the export of graphiz mindmaps   Backlinks org-roam, org-ref, org-noter Covers websites, bibliographies, and pdfs respectively    A key component in this workflow is actually facilitated by the fabulous org-roam-bibtex or ORB. The basic idea is to ensure meaningful templates which interpolate smoothly with org-roam, org-ref, helm-bibtex, and org-capture.\nBasic Variables Given the packages we will be using, some variable settings are in order, namely:\n(setq org_notes (concat (getenv \u0026#34;HOME\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;/Git/Gitlab/Mine/Notes/\u0026#34;) zot_bib (concat (getenv \u0026#34;HOME\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;/GDrive/zotLib.bib\u0026#34;) org-directory org_notes deft-directory org_notes org-roam-directory org_notes ) Search For the search setup, the doom-emacs deft setup, by adding +deft in my init.el, worked out of the box for me. For those who do not use doom6, the following should suffice:\n(use-package deft :commands deft :init (setq deft-default-extension \u0026#34;org\u0026#34; ;; de-couples filename and note title: deft-use-filename-as-title nil deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t ;; disable auto-save deft-auto-save-interval -1.0 ;; converts the filter string into a readable file-name using kebab-case: deft-file-naming-rules \u0026#39;((noslash . \u0026#34;-\u0026#34;) (nospace . \u0026#34;-\u0026#34;) (case-fn . downcase))) :config (add-to-list \u0026#39;deft-extensions \u0026#34;tex\u0026#34;) ) For more about the doom-emacs defaults, check the Github repo. The other aspect of interacting with the notes is via the org-roam interface and will be covered below.\nBibliography Since I will be using org-ref, it makes no sense to load or work with the +biblio module at the moment. Thus this section is actually doom agnostic. The basic tools of bibliographic management from the emacs end are the venerable helm-bibtex (repo here) and org-ref (repo here). In order to make this guide complete, I will also describe the Zotero settings I have.\nZotero Without getting too deep into the weeds here, the basic requirements are:\n Zotero The better bibtex extension  The idea is to then have one top level .bib file in some handy location which you will set up to sync automatically. To make life easier, there is a tiny recording of the next steps.\n  Helm-Bibtex This venerable package is really good at interfacing with a variety of externally formatted bibliographic managers.\n(setq bibtex-completion-notes-path \u0026#34;/home/haozeke/Git/Gitlab/Mine/Notes/\u0026#34; bibtex-completion-bibliography \u0026#34;/home/haozeke/GDrive/zotLib.bib\u0026#34; bibtex-completion-pdf-field \u0026#34;file\u0026#34; bibtex-completion-notes-template-multiple-files (concat \u0026#34;#+TITLE: ${title}\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;#+ROAM_KEY: cite:${=key=}\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;* TODO Notes\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;:PROPERTIES:\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;:Custom_ID: ${=key=}\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;:NOTER_DOCUMENT: %(orb-process-file-field \\\u0026#34;${=key=}\\\u0026#34;)\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;:AUTHOR: ${author-abbrev}\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;:JOURNAL: ${journaltitle}\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;:DATE: ${date}\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;:YEAR: ${year}\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;:DOI: ${doi}\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;:URL: ${url}\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;:END:\\n\\n\u0026#34; ) ) doom-emacs users like me might want to wrap the above in a nice after! org-ref expression, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter.\nExplanation To break-down aspects of the configuration snippet above:\n The template includes the orb-process-file-field function to allow selecting the pdf to be used with org-noter The file field is specified to work with the .bib file generated by Zotero helm-bibtex allows for any of the keys in a .bib file to be used in a template, and an overly expressive one is more useful The ROAM_KEY is defined to ensure that cite backlinks work correctly with org-roam As I prefer to have one notes file per pdf, I have only configured the bibtex-completion-notes-template-multiple-files variable  Org-Ref As discussed above, this just makes citations much more meaningful in orgmode.\n(use-package org-ref :config (setq org-ref-completion-library \u0026#39;org-ref-ivy-cite org-ref-get-pdf-filename-function \u0026#39;org-ref-get-pdf-filename-helm-bibtex org-ref-default-bibliography (list \u0026#34;/home/haozeke/GDrive/zotLib.bib\u0026#34;) org-ref-bibliography-notes \u0026#34;/home/haozeke/Git/Gitlab/Mine/Notes/bibnotes.org\u0026#34; org-ref-note-title-format \u0026#34;* TODO %y - %t\\n :PROPERTIES:\\n :Custom_ID: %k\\n :NOTER_DOCUMENT: %F\\n :ROAM_KEY: cite:%k\\n :AUTHOR: %9a\\n :JOURNAL: %j\\n :YEAR: %y\\n :VOLUME: %v\\n :PAGES: %p\\n :DOI: %D\\n :URL: %U\\n :END:\\n\\n\u0026#34; org-ref-notes-directory \u0026#34;/home/haozeke/Git/Gitlab/Mine/Notes/\u0026#34; org-ref-notes-function \u0026#39;orb-edit-notes )) An essential aspect of this configuration is just that most of heavy lifting in terms of the notes are palmed off to helm-bibtex.\nExplanation To break-down aspects of the configuration snippet above:\n The org-ref-get-pdf-filename-function simply uses the helm-bibtex settings to find the pdf The default bibliography and notes directory are set to the same location as all the org-roam files, to encourage a flat hierarchy The org-ref-notes-function simply ensures that, like the helm-bibtex settings, I expect one file per pdf, and that I would like to use my org-roam template instead of the org-ref or helm-bibtex one  Note that for some reason, the format specifiers for org-ref are not the keys in .bib but are instead, the following7:\nIn the format, the following percent escapes will be expanded. %l The BibTeX label of the citation. %a List of author names, see also `reftex-cite-punctuation\u0026#39;. %2a Like %a, but abbreviate more than 2 authors like Jones et al. %A First author name only. %e Works like %a, but on list of editor names. (%2e and %E work as well) It is also possible to access all other BibTeX database fields: %b booktitle %c chapter %d edition %h howpublished %i institution %j journal %k key %m month %n number %o organization %p pages %P first page %r address %s school %u publisher %t title %v volume %y year %B booktitle, abbreviated %T title, abbreviated %U url %D doi %S series %N note %f pdf filename %F absolute pdf filename Usually, only %l is needed. The other stuff is mainly for the echo area display, and for (setq reftex-comment-citations t). %\u0026lt; as a special operator kills punctuation and space around it after the string has been formatted. A pair of square brackets indicates an optional argument, and RefTeX will prompt for the values of these arguments. Indexing Notes This part of the workflow builds on the concepts best known as the Zettelkasten method. More details about the philosophy behind org-roam is here.\nOrg-Roam The first part of this interface is essentially just the doom-emacs configuration, adapted for those who don\u0026rsquo;t believe in the dark side below.\n(use-package org-roam :hook (org-load . org-roam-mode) :commands (org-roam-buffer-toggle-display org-roam-find-file org-roam-graph org-roam-insert org-roam-switch-to-buffer org-roam-dailies-date org-roam-dailies-today org-roam-dailies-tomorrow org-roam-dailies-yesterday) :preface ;; Set this to nil so we can later detect whether the user has set a custom ;; directory for it, and default to `org-directory\u0026#39; if they haven\u0026#39;t.

(add-hook \u0026#39;find-file-hook (defun +org-roam-open-buffer-maybe-h () (and +org-roam-open-buffer-on-find-file (memq \u0026#39;org-roam-buffer--update-maybe post-command-hook) (not (window-parameter nil \u0026#39;window-side)) ; don\u0026#39;t proc for popups (not (eq \u0026#39;visible (org-roam-buffer--visibility))) (with-current-buffer (window-buffer) (org-roam-buffer--get-create))))) ;; Hide the mode line in the org-roam buffer, since it serves no purpose.

(add-hook \u0026#39;org-roam-buffer-prepare-hook #\u0026#39;hide-mode-line-mode)) ;; Since the org module lazy loads org-protocol (waits until an org URL is ;; detected), we can safely chain `org-roam-protocol\u0026#39; to it.

Like helm-bibtex, ORB allows taking arbitrary keys from the .bib file.\nOrg Noter The final aspect of a pdf workflow is simply ensuring that every pdf is associated with notes. The philosophy of org-noter is best described here. Only minor tweaks should be required to get this working with interleave as well.\n(use-package org-noter :after (:any org pdf-view) :config (setq ;; The WM can handle splits org-noter-notes-window-location \u0026#39;other-frame ;; Please stop opening frames org-noter-always-create-frame nil ;; I want to see the whole file org-noter-hide-other nil ;; Everything is relative to the main notes file org-noter-notes-search-path (list org_notes) ) ) Evidently, from my configuration, it appears that I decided to use org-noter over the more commonly described interleave because it has better support for working with multiple documents linked to one file.\nOrg-Protocol I will only cover the bare minimum relating to the use of org-capture here, because eventually I intend to handle a lot more cases with orca. Note that this part of the workflow has more to do with using org-roam with websites than pdf files.\nTemplates This might get complicated but I am only trying to get the bare minimum for org-protocol right now.\n;; Actually start using templates (after! org-capture ;; Firefox and Chrome (add-to-list \u0026#39;org-capture-templates \u0026#39;(\u0026#34;P\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Protocol\u0026#34; entry ; key, name, type (file+headline +org-capture-notes-file \u0026#34;Inbox\u0026#34;) ; target \u0026#34;* %^{Title}\\nSource: %u, %c\\n #+BEGIN_QUOTE\\n%i\\n#+END_QUOTE\\n\\n\\n%?\u0026#34; :prepend t ; properties :kill-buffer t)) (add-to-list \u0026#39;org-capture-templates \u0026#39;(\u0026#34;L\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Protocol Link\u0026#34; entry (file+headline +org-capture-notes-file \u0026#34;Inbox\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;* %? [[%:link][%(transform-square-brackets-to-round-ones \\\u0026#34;%:description\\\u0026#34;)]]\\n\u0026#34; :prepend t :kill-buffer t)) ) Conclusions At this point, many might argue that since by the end, only one template is called, defining the rest were pointless. They would be right, however, this is just how my configuration evolved. Feel free to cannibalize this for your personal benefit. Eventually I plan to expand this into something with org-journal as well, but not right now.\n Rohit Goswami that is, from the landing page; obviously [return] This is a reference to my fantastic pet, named Yoda [return] Recorded with SimpleScreenRecorder, cut with LosslessCut, uploaded to YouTube, and embedded with a Hugo shortcode [return] The video uses org-ref-notes-function-many-files as the org-ref-notes-function so the template looks a little different [return] For some strange reason a lot of online posts suggested Dropbox for syncing notes, which makes no sense to me, it is always better to have version control and ignore rules [return] Therefore clearly proving that the cookies of the dark side have no power in the holy text editor war [return] Where these are from the org-ref documentation [return]   ","permalink":"https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-note-workflow/","tags":["ramblings","explanations"],"title":"An Orgmode Note Workflow"},{"categories":["programming"],"contents":" Background I have, in the past written about how I made the switch to Colemak. However, until recently, I was still trying to mimic the VIM keybindings from QWERTY. This is a post where I discuss the changes I made to ensure that I never have to stretch my fingers in odd ways again. The main idea is expressed well by vim-colemak.\nColemak layout: | QWERTY layout: `12345 67890-= Move around: | (instead of) `12345 67890-= qwfpg jluy;[]\\  e | k qwert yuiop[]\\  arstd HNEIo\u0026#39; h i | h l asdfg HJKL;\u0026#39; zxcvb km,./ n | j zxcvb nm,./ Emacs Though I have mentioned publicly, that I was using the regular QWERTY motion keys, I realized I had actually started to use the mouse more often, simply because it was a pain to navigate. Thankfully, emacs has evil-colemak-basics, which is fabulous. For reference, these make it really easy for QWERTY users to make the switch if they\u0026rsquo;re previously used to VIM bindings.\n   Colemak Qwerty Action States At Qwerty position? Remarks     h, n, e, i h, j, k, l navigate mnvo yes    k, K n, N search next/previous mnvo yes    u, U i, I insert _nv_ yes    l u undo _nv_ yes    N J join lines _nv_ yes    E K lookup mnv_ yes    u i inner text object keymap ___o yes    f, F e, E jump to end of word mnvo yes with t-f-j rotation   t, T f, f jump to character mnvo yes with t-f-j rotation   j, J t, T jump until character mnvo no with t-f-j rotation   j, J e, E jump to end of word mnvo no without t-f-j rotation    Where the table above is from the fantastic readme.\nI still had some issues, mostly relating to searching in buffers, so I ended using swiper-isearch more which is a bonus too.\nPdf-Tools For my doom-emacs configuration, I also set the following map:\n(after! pdf-view (add-hook! \u0026#39;pdf-view-mode-hook (evil-colemak-basics-mode -1)) (map! :map pdf-view-mode-map :n \u0026#34;g g\u0026#34; #\u0026#39;pdf-view-first-page :n \u0026#34;G\u0026#34; #\u0026#39;pdf-view-last-page :n \u0026#34;N\u0026#34; #\u0026#39;pdf-view-next-page-command :n \u0026#34;E\u0026#34; #\u0026#39;pdf-view-previous-page-command :n \u0026#34;e\u0026#34; #\u0026#39;evil-collection-pdf-view-previous-line-or-previous-page :n \u0026#34;n\u0026#34; #\u0026#39;evil-collection-pdf-view-next-line-or-next-page ) Where the most important thing is the hook which removes the evil-colemak-basics binding. Since it is a single mode and hook, after-hook! is the same as after-hook1.\nWindow Management Somehow these are not part of the evil-colemak defaults.\n(after! evil (map! :map evil-window-map (:leader (:prefix (\u0026#34;w\u0026#34; . \u0026#34;Select Window\u0026#34;) :n :desc \u0026#34;Left\u0026#34; \u0026#34;h\u0026#34; \u0026#39;evil-window-left :n :desc \u0026#34;Up\u0026#34; \u0026#34;e\u0026#34; \u0026#39;evil-window-up :n :desc \u0026#34;Down\u0026#34; \u0026#34;n\u0026#34; \u0026#39;evil-window-down :n :desc \u0026#34;Right\u0026#34; \u0026#34;i\u0026#34; \u0026#39;evil-window-right )) )) Search Harmonizing with Vimium.\n(after! evil (map! :map evil-motion-state-map (:n :desc \u0026#34;Previous match\u0026#34; \u0026#34;K\u0026#34; \u0026#39;evil-ex-search-previous :n :desc \u0026#34;Next match\u0026#34; \u0026#34;k\u0026#34; \u0026#39;evil-ex-search-next :n :desc \u0026#34;Forward search\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; \u0026#39;evil-search-forward ) )) Vimium I use the excellent vimium to make Chrome be a little less annoying. Luckily the Wiki seems to have a reasonable suggestion for colemak.

However, for all the reasons listed here, relating to its accuracy, which have not been fixed even though the post was over 5 years ago, I ended up having to go with the closed source Mathematica.\nPackages Support for Mathematica in modern orgmode is mainly through the use of ob-mathematica, which is the official org-babel extension (from contrib) for working with Mathematica. However, ob-mathematica relies on the now-defunct mma package for font-locking, which is less than ideal. Thankfully, there exists the excellent wolfram-mode package which happens to be in MELPA as well. Finally, since the default return type of a mathematica block is an input-string meant to be used in another mathematica block, which is not useful when we work with org-babel, we will use the excellent mash.pl utility from here, as suggested by the ob-mathematica package to sanitize our output and set a unifying path.\nSo to recap, use your favorite manager to get:\n ob-mathematica (in contrib) wolfram-mode (MELPA) mash.pl (from here)\u0026nbsp;1  After obtaining the packages, the configuration is then simply\u0026nbsp;2:\n;; Load mathematica from contrib (org-babel-do-load-languages \u0026#39;org-babel-load-languages (append org-babel-load-languages \u0026#39;((mathematica . t)) )) ;; Sanitize output and deal with paths (setq org-babel-mathematica-command \u0026#34;~/.local/bin/mash\u0026#34;) ;; Font-locking (add-to-list \u0026#39;org-src-lang-modes \u0026#39;(\u0026#34;mathematica\u0026#34; . wolfram)) ;; For wolfram-mode (setq mathematica-command-line \u0026#34;~/.local/bin/mash\u0026#34;) Results LaTeX Now we are in a position to simply evaluate content with font-locking.

We will broadly follow a historical development trend to understand the process. That is, we will begin by considering the Bootstrap method. This in turn requires knowledge of the Jacknife method, which is understandable from a simple bias variance perspective. Finally we will close out the discussion by considering the utility and trade-offs of the Bagging technique, and will draw attention to the fact that the Bagging method was contrasted to another popular ensemble method, namely the Random Forest method, in the previous section.\nBefore delving into the mathematics, recall that the approach taken by bagging is given as per Cichosz (2015) to be:\n create base models with bootstrap samples of the training set combine models by unweighted voting (for classification) or by averaging (for regression)  The reason for covering the Jacknife method is to develop an intuition relating to the sampling of data described in the following table:\n   Data-set Size per sample Estimator     Reduces Jacknife   Remains the same Bootstrap   Increases data-augmentation    Bias Variance Trade-offs We will recall, for this discussion, the bias variance trade off which is the basis of our model accuracy estimates (for regression) as per the formulation of James et al. (2013).\n\\begin{equation} E(y₀-\\hat{f}(x₀))²=\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{f}(x₀))+[\\mathrm{Bias(\\hat{f(x₀)})}]²+\\mathrm{Var}(ε) \\end{equation}\nWhere:\n \\(E(y_{0}-\\hat{f}(x_{0}))²\\) is the expected test MSE, or the average test MSE if \\(f\\) is estimated with a large number of training sets and tested at each \\(x₀\\) The variance is the amount by which our approximation \\(\\hat{f}\\) will change if estimated by a different training set, or the flexibility error The bias is the (reducible) approximation error, caused by not fitting to the training set exactly \\(\\mathrm{Var}(ε)\\) is the irreducible error  We will also keep in mind, going forward the following requirements of a good estimator:\n Low variance AND low bias Typically, the variance increases while the bias decreases as we use more flexible methods (i.e. methods which fit the training set better1)  Also for the rest of this section, we will need to recall from Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009), that the bias is given by:\n\\begin{equation} [E(\\hat{f_{k}}(x₀)-f(x₀)]² \\end{equation}\nWhere the expectation averages over the randomness in the training data.\nTo keep things in perspective, recall from Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009):\n  Figure 1: Test and training error as a function of model complexity\n  Jacknife Estimates We will model our discussion on the work of Efron (1982). Note that:\n The \\(\\hat{θ}\\) symbol is an estimate of the true quantity \\(θ\\) This is defined by the estimate being \\(\\hat{θ}=θ(\\hat{F})\\) \\(\\hat{F}\\) is the empirical probability distribution, defined by mass \\(1/n\\) at \\(xᵢ ∀ i∈I\\), i is from 1 to n  The points above establishes our bias to be given by \\(E_Fθ(\\hat{F})-θ(F)\\) such that \\(E_F\\) is the expectation under x₁⋯xₙ~F.\nTo derive the Jacknife estimate \\((\\tilde{θ})\\) we will simply sequentially delete points xᵢ (changing \\(\\hat{F}\\)), and recompute our estimate \\(\\hat{θ}\\), which then simplifies to:\n\\begin{equation} \\tilde{θ}\\equiv n\\hat{θ}-(\\frac{n-1}{n})∑_{i=1}ⁿ\\hat{θ} \\end{equation}\nIn essence, the Jacknife estimate is obtained by making repeated estimates on increasingly smaller data-sets. This intuition lets us imagine a method which actually makes estimates on larger data-sets (which is the motivation for data augmentation) or, perhaps not so intuitively, on estimates on data-sets of the same size.\nBootstrap Estimates Continuing with the same notation, we will note that the bootstrap is obtained by draw random data-sets with replacement from the training data, where each sample is the same size as the original; as noted by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009).\nWe will consider the bootstrap estimate for the standard deviation of the \\(\\hat{θ}\\) operator, which is denoted by \\(σ(F,n,\\hat{\\theta})=σ(F)\\)\nThe bootstrap is simple the standard deviation at the approximate F, i.e., at \\(F=\\hat{F}\\):\n\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\mathrm{SD}}=\\sigma(\\hat{F}) \\end{equation}\nSince we generally have no closed form analytical form for \\(σ(F)\\) we must use a Monte Carlo algorithm:\n Fit a non parametric maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of F, i.e. \\(\\hat{F}\\) Draw a sample from \\(\\hat{F}\\) and calculate the estimate of \\(\\hat{θ}\\) on that sample, say, \\(\\hat{θ}\\^*\\) Repeat 2 to get multiple (say B) replications of \\(\\hat{θ}\\^*\\)  Now we know that as \\(B→∞\\) then our estimate would match \\(σ(\\hat{F})\\) perfectly, however, since that itself is an estimate of the value we are actually interested in, in practice there is no real point using a very high B value.\nNote that in actual practice we simply use the given training data with repetition and do not actually use an MLE of the approximate true distribution to generate samples. This causes the bootstrap estimate to be unreasonably good, since there is always significant overlap between the training and test samples during the model fit. This is why cross validation demands non-overlapping data partitions.\nConnecting Estimates The somewhat surprising result can be proved when \\(\\hat{θ}=θ(\\hat{F}\\) is a quadratic functional, namely:\n\\begin{equation}\\hat{\\mathrm{Bias}}_{boot}=\\frac{n-1}{n} \\hat{\\mathrm{Bias}}_{jack}\\end{equation}\nIn practice however, we will simply recall that the Jacknife tends to overestimate, and the Bootstrap tends to underestimation.\nBagging Bagging, is motivated by using the bootstrap methodology to improve the estimate or prediction directly, instead of using it as a method to asses the accuracy of an estimate. It is a representative of the so-called parallel ensemble methods where the base learners are generated in parallel. As such, the motivation is to reduce the error by exploiting the independence of base learners (true for mathematically exact bootstrap samples, but not really true in practice).\nMathematically the formulation of Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009) establishes a connection between the Bayesian understanding of the bootstrap mean as a posterior average, however, here we will use a more heuristic approach.\nWe have noted above that the bagging process simply involves looking at different samples in differing orders. This has some stark repercussions for tree-based methods, since the trees are grown with a greedy approach.\n Bootstrap samples may cause different trees to be produced This causes a reduction in the variance, especially when not too many samples are considered Averaging, reduces variance while leaving bias unchanged  Practically, these separate trees being averaged allows for varying importance values of the variables to be calculated.\nIn particular, following Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009), it is possible to see that the MSE tends to decrease by bagging.\n\\begin{align} E_P[Y-\\hat{f}^*(x)]² \u0026amp; = \u0026amp; E_P[Y-f*{ag}(x)+f^*_{ag}(x)-\\hat{f}^*(x)]² \\\\\n\u0026amp; = \u0026amp; E_P[Y-f^*_{ag}(x)]²+E_P[\\hat{f}^*(x)-f^*_{ag}(x)]² ≥ E_P[Y-f^*_{ag}(x)]² \\end{align}\nWhere:\n The training observations are independently drawn from a distribution \\(P\\) \\(f_{ag}(x)=E_P\\hat{f}\\^*(x)\\) is the ideal aggregate estimator  For the formulation above, we assume that \\(f_{ag}\\) is a true bagging estimate, which draws samples from the actual population. The upper bound is obtained from the variance of the \\(\\hat{f}\\^*(x)\\) around the mean, \\(f_{ag}\\)\nPractically, we should note the following:\n The regression trees are deep The greedy algorithm growing the trees cause them to be unstable (sensitive to changes in input data) Each tree has a high variance, and low bias Averaging these trees reduces the variance  Missing from the discussion above is how exactly the training and test sets are used in a bagging algorithm, as well as an estimate for the error for each base learner. This has been reported in the code above as the OOB error, or out of bag error. We have, as noted by Zhou (2012) and Breiman (1996) the following considerations.\n Given \\(m\\) training samples, the probability that the iᵗʰ sample is selected 0,1,2\u0026hellip; times is approximately Poisson distributed with \\(λ=1\\) The probability of the iᵗʰ example will occur at least once is then \\(1-(1/e)≈0.632\\) This means for each base learner, there are around \\(36.8\\) % original training samples which have not been used in its training process  The goodness can thus be estimated using these OOB error, which is simply an estimate of the error of the base tree on the OOB samples.\nAs a final note, random forests are conceptually easily understood by combining bagging with subspace sampling, which is why in most cases and packages, we used bagging as a special case of random forests, i.e. when no subspace sampling is performed, random forests algorithms perform bagging.\nReferences   Breiman, Leo. 1996. \u0026ldquo;Bagging Predictors.\u0026rdquo; Machine Learning 24 (2): 123\u0026ndash;40. https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1018054314350.\n\n Cichosz, Pawel. 2015.

They are successful, enthusiastic, and curious. By the time they leave, only one third still receive straight As. The other two thirds get lower grades, do not enjoy their studies, and are not fun to teach. Is Camwick University a success? Camwick could point to its excellent teaching assessment scores and argue that it is ‘adding value’: students emerge knowing more. Future employers love the University’s policy of assigning grades – the University ranks its students, saving companies the bother of assessing job applicants themselves. But should a University be a sorting service? Isn’t something wrong with an institution that takes in mainly A-quality input and turns out less than half A-quality output? If a University fails to turn out as much A-quality enthusiasts as come in, is it in fact a place of intellectual destruction, throwing away the potential of the majority of its students? What are the roots of this destruction?\nExams I would recommend that Camwick consider abolishing traditional exams. In the current system, Camwick teaches Anna, Bob, and Charlie, who are all smart, then examines them; Anna comes \u0026lsquo;top\u0026rsquo;, Bob \u0026lsquo;second\u0026rsquo; and Charlie \u0026lsquo;third\u0026rsquo;. Perhaps Charlie, given a little more time, would have figured out the material, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite ready when the exam arrived - perhaps because other courses consumed his attention.\nBob\u0026rsquo;s response to his \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo; is to adopt strategies of tlittle educational value: he parrot learns, he crams, and he asks lecturers to tell him what\u0026rsquo;s going to be on the exam. The exams become the focus of attention, even though the purpose of Bob\u0026rsquo;s going to the University was learning.\nCharlie\u0026rsquo;s response is to give up on doing \u0026lsquo;well\u0026rsquo;, and coast through University, no longer understanding everything. He loses self-worth and resents the University for making him feel bad.\nSome courses at Camwick assign grades using continuous assessment instead of exams. But continuous assessment has the same effect as exams on Bob and Charlie. So course grades based on continuous assessment should be abolished at the same time as exams.\n  Figure 1: Everyone can get an A, regardless of learning rate, if their education is not halted by exams. Traditional system on the left, with an educational system on the right.\n  If Camwick had no exams, the focus of attention would have to be elsewhere. How about education, for example? Students could spend their time at Camwick exploring subjects that interest them, and attending classes that offer something they want to know about, free from the stress and misdirection of the exam system. Lecturers would at all times be friends rather than adversaries. [When I was an undergraduate at Cambridge, I asked a physis lecturer to clarify topic \\(N\\), which I felt had not been covered clearly. His response: \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what I love about \\(N\\): some students get it, some don\u0026rsquo;t - so we get beautiful bell shaped curves in the exam.\u0026ldquo;]\nOf course the extreme suggestion of abolishing all exams will not go down well: \u0026ldquo;What about standards?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How can we get funding if we do not\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do we award degrees that people will respect?\u0026rdquo; Traditionalists might say that students appreciate exams for the targets and feedback. Well, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to stop us giving students targets or feedback. We can provide events just like exams, if students want them - self-administered tests, for example, would allow students to check how well they have assimilated all the material in a course. Other systems of targets and feedback that students enjoy include project work, problem-based learning, and portfolio-based assessment.\nAs a compromise, let\u0026rsquo;s modify our proposal a little: Camwick should become a place where the only achievable grade is an A. I\u0026rsquo;m not recommending that we simply give everyone an A. It\u0026rsquo;s a crime to let standards slip. When I say everyone should get an A, I mean that everyone should be allowed to get to an A.\nThink back to Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice grasped most of the material in the course and achieved an A. Given a little more time and little less stress, Bob and Charlie could probably have grasped it all too, and become equally strong masters of the material. What good does it do Bob and Charlie to record the fact that they were a little slower than alice? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it have been better, educationally, to give Bob and Charlie a little more time and help, so that they achieved the same A standard?\nDoes a bus-driver-training school rank its graduating drivers? No, it ensures that all attain the standard required of a bus-driver. Would you like to be treated by a C-grade doctor? No, everyone wants an A-grade doctor! So doctors and drivers are (I hope!) trained and trained and not let out until they are A-grade in standard. Why should other professions be treated differently?\nFigure 1a shows the command of the material of each student as a function of time in the traditional system. A traditional exam interrupts the learning process, and Bob and Charlie are recorded as having achieved a lower standard. Figure 1b shows the same students in an exam-free system, assuming they learn at the same rate as in the old system. Each student takes a different time to achieve full command of the course material. Every student has the satisfaction of achieving full command of the material.\n  Figure 2: Everyone can get an A, regardless of learning rate, if their education is not halted by exams. Traditional system on the left, with an educational system on the right.\n  The difference between the two systems is also striking if we assume that students start the course at different levels of ability. In Figure 2, albert comes from a privileged background and already knows half the course material when he arrives. Brenda and Catharine arrive at a lower educational level. Brenda and Catharine are actually faster learners than Albert, but, as Figure 2a shows, the traditional exam system rewards Albert with the A grade (\u0026lsquo;congratulations, you started first!\u0026rsquo;), and brands Brenda and Catharine failures. In the \u0026lsquo;Only A-grades\u0026rsquo; system, everyone attains an A-grade in due course; and Albert isn\u0026rsquo;t actually first to finish.\nThe information about \u0026lsquo;who finished when\u0026rsquo; could in principle be retained in order to provide some sort of student-ranking service to employers, but I would strongly urge the destruction of all such records. Only the achieving of an A grade should be recorded, nothing else. Why?\n Because being ranked creates stress. Because students who are competing with each other for ranks may be reluctant to help each other learn. In contrast, in the \u0026lsquo;Only A-grades\u0026rsquo; system, the top students lose nothing if they help their peers; indeed, they may gain in several ways: peer-teaching strengthens the students\u0026rsquo; grasp on material, and often speeds up the whole class. Evidence that a student is a quick learner may well make itself evident in her transcript without rankings being made: Alice, covering material quickly, will have time to take extra courses. So in one year she\u0026rsquo;ll accumulate a slightly fatter sheaf of A-grade qualifications. What value are rankings? If future employers want students to be formally evaluated, they can pay for an evaluation service. Why ruin a great institution? The very best students might like grades too, as they enjoy being congratulated. But the \u0026lsquo;only A-grades\u0026rsquo; system will congratualte them too.  These ideas are not new, nor are they unprecedented. In many German Universities, first- and second-year courses have no grades, no obligatory coursework, and no obligatory exams. End-of-course exams are provided only as a service to students, to help them find out if they have indeed grasped the material and are ready progress to the next stage.\nIn practice, how should we organize courses so that everyone reaches 100% mastery? For Bob and Charlie\u0026rsquo;s benefit, the average pace probably has to be reduced. Figure 3 shows one way of organizing the material in stages, so that a class is kept together. Whenever Alice has completed the material in a stage, she can spend time on other interests, or can help other members of the class.\n  Figure 3: Possible course plan. This scheme assumes that the students have rates of progress ranging from A (fastest) to C (slowest). Every two weeks, a consolidation period is inserted to ensure that C has assimilated all the learning objectives. Alice can use the consolidation period to pursue others interests or act as a peer-teacher.\n  Camwick staff who say \u0026ldquo;we can\u0026rsquo;t possibly cover a full degree course if we reduce the pace!\u0026rdquo; should bear in mind that, had Bob and charlie gone to a less prestigious University, they probably would have got first-class degrees. How can this paradox - going slowing and arriving at almost the same time - be explained? I suspect an important factor is this: struggling students get ever slower if we pile on new material before they have assimilated the old. For example, 2ⁿᵈ-year Lagrangian dynamics is difficult to absorb if one hasn\u0026rsquo;t grasped 1ˢᵗ-year Newtonian dynamics. So the steady linear progress assumed in Figures 1 to 3 is a poor model of Carlie. The more Charlie is left behind, the slower he learns. This means that the true difference in pace between Alice and Charlie need not be very big. If Charlie gets lost and left behind, we are wasting everyone\u0026rsquo;s time by having him sit in classes where new material is presented. A stitch in time saves nine (Figure 4).\n  Figure 4: A stitch in time saves nine. Curve C shows Charlie\u0026rsquo;s progress in a course taught at the pace that is ideal for Alice. The more Charlie is left behind, the slower he learns. By the end of the course, there is a big gap between A and C. Curve C′ shows Charlie\u0026rsquo;s progress in a course taught at the pace that is ideal for him. Just a small decrease in class pace allows the big gap between Alice and Charlie to be eliminated.\n  Teaching methods must be modified to ensure that everyone in the class benefits. I advocate interactive teaching: students are asked questions and encouraged to ask questions and to be active participants in their own learning. It\u0026rsquo;s not enough to ask a question and let one person in the class (Alice!) answer it. The whole class must have the chance to think, puzzle and discuss; the teacher must ascertain the level of understanding of the whole class. In large classes, I find Mazur\u0026rsquo;s voting method works well: a lecture is centered on two or three carefully chosen questions with multiple-choice answers. Students discuss a question with their neighbors, then all vote. The vote informs the lecturer whether previous material has been understood. Diversity of votes can seed a useful discussion.\nTo conclude, here are a few further advantages of the educational approach advocated here:\n Happy, curious, and self-motivated students are fun to teach. At present, British students have little choice of university teaching and assessment style: all universities give out grades. Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we offer them a choice? Some students would like the chance to go to a place with high standards where only A-grades are awarded. If some universities adopt student-centered educational policies and stop ranking students, perhaps these attitudes will spread to schools, with consequent benefits to pupils, and in due course, to universities. Dumbed-down A levels could be replaced by educational programmes that ensure that everyone attains their maximum potential and feels happy about it. Happy graduates who get A grades are likely to become grateful alumni donors.

Going through the changes reminds me of a whole of posts I never got around to writing.\nAnyway, recently I gained access to another HPC cluster, with a standard configuration (bash, old CentOS) and decided to track my provisioning steps. This is really a very streamlined experience by now, since I\u0026rsquo;ve used the same setup across scores of machines. This is actually also a generic intro to configuring user setups on HPC (high performance cluster) machines, if one is inclined to read it in that manner. To that end, sections of this post involve restrictions relating to user privileges which aren\u0026rsquo;t normally part of most Dotfile setups.\nAside  Dotfiles define most people who maintain them No two sets are ever exactly alike They fall somewhere between winging it for each machine and using something like Chef or Ansible Tracking dotfiles is really close to having a sort of out-of-context journal  Before I settled on using the fabulous dotgit, I considered several alternatives, most notably GNU stow.\nPreliminaries It is important to note the environment into which I had to get my setup.\nSSH Setup  The very first thing to do is to use a new ssh-key   export myKey=\u0026#34;someName\u0026#34; ssh-keygen -f $HOME/.ssh/$myKey # I normally don\u0026#39;t set a password ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/$myKey ssh-copy-id $myHPC # myHPC being an IP address I more often than not tend to back this up with a cutesy alias, also because I do not always get my username of choice on these machines. So in $HOME/.ssh/config I use:\nHost myHPC Hostname 127.0.0.1 User somethingIgot IdentityFile ~/.ssh/myKey Harvesting Information  I normally use neofetch on new machines   mkdir -p $HOME/Git/Github cd $HOME/Git/Github git clone https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch.git cd neofetch ./neofetch   Figure 1: Neofetch Output\n  Where the top has been tastefully truncated. Just for context, the latest bash as of this writing is v5.0.16 so, that\u0026rsquo;s not too bad, given that neofetch works for bash ≥ 3.2\nTODO Circumventing User Restrictions with Nix  A post in and of itself would be required to explain why and how users are normally restricted from activities in cluster nodes Here, we leverage the nix-package management system to circumvent these User installation of nix is sadly non-trivial, so this might be of some use\u0026nbsp;1  Testing nix-user-chroot  We will first check namespace support   # Errored out unshare --user --pid echo YES # Worked! zgrep CONFIG_USER_NS /boot/config-$(uname -r) # CONFIG_USER_NS=y Thankfully we have support for namespaces, so we can continue with nix-user-chroot.\n Since we definitely do not have rustup or rustc on the HPC, we will use a prebuilt binary of nix-user-chroot   cd $HOME \u0026amp;\u0026amp; wget -O nix-user-chroot https://github.com/nix-community/nix-user-chroot/releases/download/1.0.2/nix-user-chroot-bin-1.0.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  Similar to the wiki example, we will use $HOME/.nix   cd ~/ chmod +x nix-user-chroot mkdir -m 0755 ~/.nix ./nix-user-chroot ~/.nix bash -c \u0026#39;curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh\u0026#39;  Only, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t work  Turns out that since unshare is too old, nix-user-chroot won\u0026rsquo;t work either.\nUsing PRoot PRoot is pretty neat in general, they even have a nice website describing it.\n Set a folder up for local installations (this is normally done by my Dotfiles, but we might as well have one here too)   mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin  Get a binary from the GitLab artifacts   cd $HOME mkdir tmp cd tmp wget -O artifacts.zip https://gitlab.com/proot/proot/-/jobs/452350181/artifacts/download unzip artifacts.zip mv dist/proot $HOME/.local/bin  Bind and install nix   mkdir ~/.nix export PROOT_NO_SECCOMP=1 proot -b ~/.nix:/nix export PROOT_NO_SECCOMP=1 curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh If you\u0026rsquo;re very unlucky, like I was, you may be greeted by a lovely little error message along the lines of:\n/nix/store/ddmmzn4ggz1f66lwxjy64n89864yj9w9-nix-2.3.3/bin/nix-store: /opt/ohpc/pub/compiler/gcc/5.4.0/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.22\u0026#39; not found (required by /nix/store/c0b76xh2za9r9r4b0g3iv4x2lkw1zzcn-aws-sdk-cpp-1.7.90/lib/libaws-cpp-sdk-core.so) Which basically is as bad as it sounds.

It was a major change in my life, and it took forever to get acclimatized to. I do not think I\u0026rsquo;ll ever again be in a position to make such a change in my life again, but it was definitely worth it.\nTouch Typing My interest in touch typing in I decided to digitize my notes for posterity, during the last two years of my undergraduate studies back in Harcourt Butler Technical Institute (HBTI) Kanpur, India. in one of my many instances of yak shaving, I realized I could probably consume and annotate a lot more content by typing faster. Given that at that stage I was already a fast talker, it seemed like a natural extension. There was probably an element of nostalgia involved as well. That and the end of a bachelors involves the thesis, which generally involves a lot of typing.\nThere were (and are) some fantastic resources for learning to touch type nowadays, I personally used:\n Typing.com This is short, but a pretty good basic setup. The numbering and special characters are a bit much to take in at the level of practice you get by completing all the previous exercises, but eventually they make for a good workout. TypingClub This is what I ended up working my way through. It is comprehensive, beautiful, and fun.  Also, later, I ended up using keybr a lot, simply because typing gibberish is a good way of practicing, and it is independent of the keyboard layout.\nJust to foreshadow things, the enemy facing me at this point was the layout itself1.\n  Alternate layouts Having finally broken into the giddy regimes of 150+ wpm, I was ecstatic, and decided to start working my way through some longer reports. However, I quickly realized I was unable to type for more than a couple of minutes without getting terribly cramped. Once it got to the point of having to visit a physiotherapist, I had to call it quits. At that stage, relearning the entire touch typing corpus, given that I already was used to QWERTY, seemed pretty bleak.\nIt took forever, and I ended up applying my choices to my phone keyboard as well, which presumably helped me in terms of increasing familiarity, had the unintended effect of making me seem distant to people I was close to, since my verbose texts suddenly devolved to painful one-liners.\nThe alternative layouts I tried were:\n DVORAK At the time, TypingClub only supported QWERTY and DVORAK, so it was pretty natural for me to try it out. There are also some very nice comics about it. I remember that it was pretty neat, with a good even distribution, until I tried coding. The placement of the semicolons make it impossible to use while programming. I would still say it makes for a comfortable layout, as long as special characters are not required.     CarpalX I experimented with the entire carpalx family, but I was unable to get used to it. I liked QFMLWY best. I do recommend reading the training methodology, especially if anyone is interested in numerical optimization in general. More importantly, though it was relatively easy to set up on my devices and operating systems, the fact that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t natively supported meant a lot of grief whenever I inevitably had to use a public computer.     Colemak Eventually I decided to go with Colemak, especially since it is widely available. Nothing is easier than setxkbmap us -variant colemak -option grp:alt_shift_toggle on public machines and it\u0026rsquo;s easy on Windows as well. Colemak seems like a good compromise. I personally have not been able to reach the same speeds I managed with QWERTY, even after a year, but then again, I can be a lot more consistent, and it hurts less. Nowadays, Colemak has made its way onto most typing sites as well, including TypingClub    What about VIM?  DVORAK makes it impossible, so do most other layouts, but there are some tutorials purporting to help use vim movement with DVORAK Colemak isn\u0026rsquo;t any better, but the fact of the matter is that once you know VIM on QWERTY, and have separately internalized colemak or something else, hitting keys is just hitting keys  All that said, I still occasionally simply remap HJKL (QWERTY movement) to HNEI (Colemak analog) when it is feasible. update: I actually ended up refactoring my entire Dotfiles to use more Colemak native bindings, as described in this post.\nConclusion Changing layouts was a real struggle. Watching my WPM drop back to lower than hunt and peck styles was pretty humiliating, especially since the reports kept coming in, and more than once I switched to QWERTY. However, since then, I have managed to stay on course. I guess if I think about it, it boils down to a few scattered thoughts:\n Typing is kinda like running a marathon, knowing how it is done and doing it are two different things Tell everyone, so people can listen to you lament your reduced speed and not hate you for replying slowly Practice everyday, because, well, it works out in the long run, even when you plateau Alternate shifts! That\u0026rsquo;s really something which should show up more in tutorials, especially for listicles, not changing the shifts will really hurt Try and get a mechanical keyboard (like the Anne Pro 2 or the Coolermaster Masterkeys), they\u0026rsquo;re fun and easy to change layouts on   The images are from here, where there\u0026rsquo;s also an effort based metric used to score keyboard layouts.

I thought it might be frivolous, or worse, might outweigh the other kinds of articles I would like to write. However, like most things, that which is ignored just grows, so it is easier to just write and forget about it.\nThe Show Much has been said about how Bojack Horseman is one of the best shows ever, and they\u0026rsquo;re all correct. For that matter I won\u0026rsquo;t be going into the details of how every episode ties together a tapestry of lives in a meaningful way, or any of that. The show was amazingly poignant. The characters felt real. Which actually leads me to the real issue.\nThe End The end of Bojack was good. It was the way it was meant to be. For a slice-of-life show, it is a natural conclusion. It isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary that any catharsis occurs or that the characters change or become better or all that jazz. It isn\u0026rsquo;t about giving the viewers closure. It is simply about a window onto the lives of (fictional) characters being shut. To that end, I disliked attempts to bring closure in the show itself.\nOne of the main reasons why I felt strongly enough to write this, is simply because when I looked around, the prevailing opinion was that the main character should have been killed off, for his sins. This strikes me as a very flippant attitude to take. It reeks of people trying to make the show a cautionary tale, which is frankly speaking a weird approach to take towards any fictional story. The idea that the character should be redeemed also seemed equally weak, for much the same reasons.\nThe fact that the characters are hypocrites, and that none of them are as good or bad as they make themselves out to be is one of the best parts of the show.\nConclusion That\u0026rsquo;s actually all I have to say about this. I thought of adding relevant memes or listing episodes or name dropping sites, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t buzzfeed. The show is incredible, and there are far better ways of proving that.

## between, first, last Question 6.8 - Page 262 In this exercise, we will generate simulated data, and will then use this data to perform best subset selection.\n(a) Use the =rnorm()=function to generate a predictor \\(X\\) of length \\(n = 100\\), as well as a noise vector \\(\\eta\\) of length \\(n = 100\\).\n(b) Generate a response vector \\(Y\\) of length \\(n = 100\\) according to the model \\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\beta2X^2 + \\beta_3X^3 + \\eta\\], where \\(\\beta_{0}\\) , \\(\\beta_{1}\\), \\(\\beta_{2}\\), and \\(\\beta_{3}\\) are constants of your choice.\n\u0026copy; Use the regsubsets() function to perform best subset selection in order to choose the best model containing the predictors \\(X\\), \\(X^{2}\\), \u0026hellip;, \\(X^{10}\\). What is the best model obtained according to \\(C_p\\) , BIC, and adjusted \\(R^2\\) ? Show some plots to provide evidence for your answer, and report the coefficients of the best model obtained. Note you will need to use the data.frame() function to create a single data set containing both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n(d) Repeat \u0026copy;, using forward stepwise selection and also using backwards stepwise selection. How does your answer compare to the results in \u0026copy;?\n(e) Now fit a lasso model to the simulated data, again using \\(X\\), \\(X^{2}\\), \u0026hellip;, \\(X^{10}\\) as predictors. Use cross-validation to select the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\). Create plots of the cross-validation error as a function of \\(\\lambda\\). Report the resulting coefficient estimates, and discuss the results obtained.\n(f) Now generate a response vector Y according to the model \\[Y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{7}X^{7} + \\eta,\\] and perform best subset selection and the lasso. Discuss the results obtained.\nAnswer a) Generate model set.seed(1984) x\u0026lt;-rnorm(100) noise\u0026lt;-rnorm(100) b) Response vector beta=c(43,5,3,6) y\u0026lt;-beta[1] + beta[2]*x + beta[3]*x^2 + beta[4]*x^3 + noise qplot(x,y)   c) Subset selection Since the question requires it, we will be using the leaps libraries.\nlibrary(leaps) df\u0026lt;-data.frame(y=y,x=x) sets=regsubsets(y~poly(x,10,raw=T),data=df,nvmax=10) sets %\u0026gt;% summary## Subset selection object ##

We will now explore this in a simulated data set.\n(a) Generate a data set with \\(p = 20\\) features, \\(n = 1,000\\) observations, and an associated quantitative response vector generated according to the model \\[Y = X\\beta + \\eta,\\] where \\(\\beta\\) has some elements that are exactly equal to zero.\n(b) Split your data set into a training set containing \\(100\\) observations and a test set containing \\(900\\) observations.\n\u0026copy; Perform best subset selection on the training set, and plot the training set MSE associated with the best model of each size.\n(d) Plot the test set MSE associated with the best model of each size.\n(e) For which model size does the test set MSE take on its minimum value? Comment on your results. If it takes on its minimum value for a model containing only an intercept or a model containing all of the features, then play around with the way that you are generating the data in (a) until you come up with a scenario in which the test set MSE is minimized for an intermediate model size.\n(f) How does the model at which the test set MSE is minimized compare to the true model used to generate the data? Comment on the coefficient values.\n(g) Create a plot displaying \\(\\sqrt{\\Sum_{j=1}^{p}(\\beta_{j}-\\hat{\\beta}_{j}^{r})^{2}}\\) for a range of values of \\(r\\), where \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{j}^{r}\\) is the $j$th coefficient estimate for the best model containing \\(r\\) coefficients.

We will now estimate the test error of this logistic regression model using the validation set approach. Do not forget to set a random seed before beginning your analysis.\n(a) Fit a logistic regression model that uses income and balance to predict default.\n(b) Using the validation set approach, estimate the test error of this model. In order to do this, you must perform the following steps:\n Split the sample set into a training set and a validation set.\n Fit a multiple logistic regression model using only the training observations.\n Obtain a prediction of default status for each individual in the validation set by computing the posterior probability of default for that individual, and classifying the individual to the default category if the posterior probability is greater than \\(0.5\\).\n Compute the validation set error, which is the fraction of the observations in the validation set that are misclassified.\n  \u0026copy; Repeat the process in (b) three times, using three different splits of the observations into a training set and a validation set. Comment on the results obtained.\n(d) Now consider a logistic regression model that predicts the prob- ability of default using income , balance , and a dummy variable for student.

How does this compare to your answer from (b)?\n(d) Based on your bootstrap estimate from \u0026copy;, provide a 95 % confidence interval for the mean of medv. Compare it to the results obtained using t.test(Boston\\$medv).

Unfortunately, there is no simple formula for computing the standard error of the median. Instead, estimate the standard error of the median using the bootstrap. Comment on your findings.\n(g) Based on this data set, provide an estimate for the tenth percentile of medv in Boston suburbs. Call this quantity \\(\\hat{\\mu_{0.1}}\\).

This data is similar in nature to the Smarket data from this chapter\u0026rsquo;s lab, except that it contains 1, 089 weekly returns for 21 years, from the beginning of 1990 to the end of 2010.\n(a) Produce some numerical and graphical summaries of the Weekly data. Do there appear to be any patterns?\n(b) Use the full data set to perform a logistic regression with Direction as the response and the five lag variables plus Volume as predictors. Use the summary function to print the results. Do any of the predictors appear to be statistically significant? If so, which ones?\n\u0026copy; Compute the confusion matrix and overall fraction of correct predictions. Explain what the confusion matrix is telling you about the types of mistakes made by logistic regression.\n(d) Now fit the logistic regression model using a training data period from 1990 to 2008, with Lag2 as the only predictor. Compute the confusion matrix and the overall fraction of correct predictions for the held out data (that is, the data from 2009 and 2010).\n(e) Repeat (d) using LDA.\n(f) Repeat (d) using QDA.\n(g) Repeat (d) using KNN with \\(K = 1\\).\n(h) Which of these methods appears to provide the best results on this data?\n(i) Experiment with different combinations of predictors, including possible transformations and interactions, for each of the methods. Report the variables, method, and associated confusion matrix that appears to provide the best results on the held out data. Note that you should also experiment with values for K in the KNN classifier.\nAnswer We will need the data in a variable for ease of use.\nweeklyDat\u0026lt;-ISLR::Weekly a) Summary Statistics Text Most of this segment relies heavily on usage of dplyr and especially the %\u0026gt;% or pipe operator for readability.

In this case we should probably think about what is going on. I would think it is because of the nature of the train-test split we performed.

In other words, your function should compute 2^3 and print out the results.\nHint: Recall that x^a raises x to the power a. Use the print() function to output the result.\n(b) Create a new function, Power2() , that allows you to pass any two numbers, x and a , and prints out the value of x^a . You can do this by beginning your function with the line\nPower2=function(x,a){} You should be able to call your function by entering, for instance,\nPower2(3,8) on the command line. This should output the value of \\(3^8\\), namely, \\(6,651\\).\n\u0026copy; Using the Power2() function that you just wrote, compute \\(10^3\\), \\(8^{17}\\), and \\(131^3\\).\n(d) Now create a new function, Power3(), that actually returns the result x^a as an R object, rather than simply printing it to the screen. That is, if you store the value x^a in an object called result within your function, then you can simply return() this result, using the following line:\nreturn(result) The line above should be the last line in your function, before the } symbol.\n(e) Now using the Power3() function, create a plot of \\(f(x)=x^2\\). The x-axis should display a range of integers from \\(1\\) to \\(10\\), and the y-axis should display \\(x^2\\) . Label the axes appropriately, and use an appropriate title for the figure. Consider displaying either the x-axis, the y-axis, or both on the log-scale. You can do this by using log=‘‘x’’, log=‘‘y’’, or log=‘‘xy’’ as arguments to the plot() function.\n(f) Create a function, PlotPower() , that allows you to create a plot of x against x^a for a fixed a and for a range of values of x. For instance, if you call\nPlotPower (1:10 ,3) then a plot should be created with an x-axis taking on values \\(1,2,\u0026hellip;,10\\) and a y-axis taking on values \\(1^3,2^3,\u0026hellip;,10^3\\)\nAnswer a) Create a Squaring Function Power=function(x){print(2^x)} Power(3)# [1] 8 b) Generalizing Power to arbitrary numbers Power2=function(x,a){print(x^a)}Power2(3,8)# [1] 6561 c) Random Testing of Power2 Power2(10,3)# [1] 1000Power2(8,17)# [1] 2.2518e+15Power2(131,2)# [1] 17161 d) Return a value Power3=function(x,a){return(x^a)} e) Plot something with Power3 Actually now would be a good place to introduce LaTeX labeling.\n#install.packages(\u0026#34;latex2exp\u0026#34;) library(latex2exp) No log scale.\nqplot(x=seq(1,10),y=Power3(seq(1,10),2)) + ggtitle(\u0026#34;Function without a log scale\u0026#34;) + geom_point() + xlab(\u0026#34;X\u0026#34;) + ylab(TeX(\u0026#34;$X^2$\u0026#34;))   With a log scale.\nqplot(x=seq(1,10),y=Power3(seq(1,10),2)) + ggtitle(\u0026#34;Function with a log scale\u0026#34;) + geom_point() + xlab(\u0026#34;X\u0026#34;) + ylab(TeX(\u0026#34;$X^2$\u0026#34;)) + scale_y_log10()   f) PlotPower Function PlotPower=function(xrange,pow){return(qplot(x=xrange,y=Power3(xrange,pow)))}plotter\u0026lt;-PlotPower(1:10,3) plotter   The R Cookbook is quite neat for some simple tasks like this.\nQuestion 4.13 - Pages 173 Using the Boston data set, fit classification models in order to predict whether a given suburb has a crime rate above or below the median.

Breaking down the rest of my requirements went a bit like this:\n What exports well to TeX? Org, Markdown, anything which goes into pandoc What displays code really well? LaTeX, Markdown, Org What allows easy visualization of code snippets? Rmarkdown, RStudio, JupyterHub, Org with babel  Clearly, orgmode is the common denominator, and ergo, a perfect JupyterHub alternative.\nSetup Throughout this post I will assume the following structure:\ntree tmp mkdir -p tmp/images touch tmp/myFakeJupyter.org    tmp        ├── images     └── myFakeJupyter.org     1 directory, 1 file    As is evident, we have a folder tmp which will have all the things we need for dealing with our setup.\nVirtual Python Without waxing too eloquent on the whole reason behind doing this, since I will rant about virtual python management systems elsewhere, here I will simply describe my preferred method, which is using poetry.\n# In a folder above tmp poetry init poetry add numpy matplotlib scipy pandas The next part is optional, but a good idea if you figure out using direnv and have configured layout_poetry as described here:\n# Same place as the poetry files echo \u0026#34;layout_poetry()\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; .envrc Note:\n We can nest an arbitrary number of the tmp structures under a single place we define the poetry setup I prefer using direnv to ensure that I never forget to hook into the right environment  Orgmode This is not an introduction to org, however in particular, there are some basic settings to keep in mind to make sure the set-up works as expected.\nIndentation Python is notoriously weird about whitespace, so we will ensure that our export process does not mangle whitespace and offend the python interpreter. We will have the following line at the top of our orgmode file:\n# -*- org-src-preserve-indentation: t; org-edit-src-content: 0; -*- Note:\n this post is actually generating the file being discussed here by  tangling the file\n You can get the whole file here  TeX Settings These are also basically optional, but at the very least you will need the following:\n#+author: Rohit Goswami #+title: Whatever #+subtitle: Wittier line about whatever #+date: \\today #+OPTIONS: toc:nil I actually use a lot of math using the TeX input mode in Emacs, so I like the following settings for math:\n# For math display #+LATEX_HEADER: \\usepackage{amsfonts} #+LATEX_HEADER: \\usepackage{unicode-math} There are a bunch of other settings which may be used, but these are the bare minimum, more on that would be in a snippet anyway.\nNote:\n rendering math in the orgmode file in this manner requires that we use XeTeX to compile the final file  Org-Python We essentially need to ensure that:\n Babel uses our virtual python The same session is used for each block  We will get our poetry python pretty easily:\nwhich python Now we will use this as a common header-arg passed into the property drawer to make sure we don\u0026rsquo;t need to set them in every code block.\nWe can use the following structure in our file:\n\\* Python Stuff :PROPERTIES: :header-args: :python /home/haozeke/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/test-2aLV_5DQ-py3.8/bin/python :session One :results output :exports both :END: Now we can simply work with code as we normally would \\#+BEGIN_SRC python print(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;) \\#+END_SRC Note:\n For some reason, this property needs to be set on every heading (as of Feb 13 2020) In the actual file you will want to remove extraneous \\ symbols:  \\* → * \\#+BEGIN_SRC → #+BEGIN_SRC \\#+END_SRC → #+END_SRC   Python Images and Orgmode To view images in orgmode as we would in a JupyterLab notebook, we will use a slight trick.\n We will ensure that the code block returns a file object with the arguments The code block should end with a print statement to actually generate the file name\nSo we want a code block like this:\n   #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output file :exports both import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_circles X, y = make_circles(100, factor=.1, noise=.1) plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, s=50, cmap=\u0026#39;autumn\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;x1\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;x2\u0026#39;) plt.savefig(\u0026#39;images/plotCircles.png\u0026#39;, dpi = 300) print(\u0026#39;images/plotCircles.png\u0026#39;) # return filename to org-mode #+end_src Which would give the following when executed:\n#+RESULTS: [[file:images/plotCircles.png]] Since that looks pretty ugly, this will actually look like this:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_circles X, y = make_circles(100, factor=.1, noise=.1) plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, s=50, cmap=\u0026#39;autumn\u0026#39;) plt.xlabel(\u0026#39;x1\u0026#39;) plt.ylabel(\u0026#39;x2\u0026#39;) plt.savefig(\u0026#39;images/plotCircles.png\u0026#39;, dpi = 300) print(\u0026#39;images/plotCircles.png\u0026#39;) # return filename to org-mode   Bonus A better way to simulate standard jupyter workflows is to just specify the properties once at the beginning.\n#+PROPERTY: header-args:python :python /home/haozeke/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/test-2aLV_5DQ-py3.8/bin/python :session One :results output :exports both This setup circumvents having to set the properties per sub-tree, though for very large projects, it is useful to use different processes.\nConclusions  The last step is of course to export the file as to a TeX file and then compile that with something like latexmk -pdfxe -shell-escape file.tex  There are a million and one variations of this of course, but this is enough to get started.\nThe whole file is also reproduced here.\n","permalink":"https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode/","tags":["tools","emacs","workflow","orgmode"],"title":"Replacing Jupyter with Orgmode"},{"categories":["programming"],"contents":" Background  I end up writing about using poetry a lot I almost always use direnv in real life too I don\u0026rsquo;t keep writing mini scripts in my .envrc  Honestly there\u0026rsquo;s nothing here anyone using the direnv wiki will find surprising, but then it is still neat to link back to.\nSetting Up Poetry This essentially works by simply modifying the global .direnvrc which essentially gets sourced by every local .envrc anyway.\nvim $HOME/.direnvrc So what we put in there is the following snippet derived from other snippets on the wiki, and is actually now there too.\n# PUT this here layout_poetry() { if [[ ! -f pyproject.toml ]]; then log_error \u0026#39;No pyproject.toml found.

It contains a number of variables for \\(777\\) different universities and colleges in the US. The variables are\n Private : Public/private indicator Apps : Number of applications received Accept : Number of applicants accepted Enroll : Number of new students enrolled Top10perc : New students from top 10 % of high school class Top25perc : New students from top 25 % of high school class F.Undergrad : Number of full-time undergraduates P.Undergrad : Number of part-time undergraduates Outstate : Out-of-state tuition Room.Board : Room and board costs Books : Estimated book costs Personal : Estimated personal spending PhD : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.\u0026rsquo;s Terminal : Percent of faculty with terminal degree S.F.Ratio : Student/faculty ratio perc.alumni : Percent of alumni who donate Expend : Instructional expenditure per student Grad.Rate : Graduation rate  Before reading the data into R, it can be viewed in Excel or a text editor.\n(a) Use the read.csv() function to read the data into R . Call the loaded data college. Make sure that you have the directory set to the correct location for the data.\n(b) Look at the data using the fix() function. You should notice that the ﬁrst column is just the name of each university. We don\u0026rsquo;t really want R to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands:\nrownames(college)=college[,1] fix(college) You should see that there is now a row.names column with the name of each university recorded. This means that R has given each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. R will not try to perform calculations on the row names. However, we still need to eliminate the ﬁrst column in the data where the names are stored. Try:\ncollege=college[,-1] fix(college) \u0026copy;\n Use the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set. Use the pairs() function to produce a scatterplot matrix of the ﬁrst ten columns or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using A[,1:10] . Use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Private . Create a new qualitative variable, called Elite , by binning the Top10perc variable. We are going to divide universities into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top \\(10%\\) of their high school classes exceeds \\(50%\\).   Elite = rep(\u0026#34;No\u0026#34;, nrow(college)) Elite [college$Top10perc \u0026gt;50]=\u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34; Elite = as.factor (Elite) college = data.frame (college, Elite) Use the summary() function to see how many elite univer- sities there are. Now use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Elite .\n Use the hist() function to produce some histograms with differing numbers of bins for a few of the quantitative vari- ables. You may fnd the command par(mfrow=c(2,2)) useful: it will divide the print window into four regions so that four plots can be made simultaneously. Modifying the arguments to this function will divide the screen in other ways. Continue exploring the data, and provide a brief summary of what you discover.  Answer Instead of reading in data, for ISLR in particular we can load the ISLR library which is on CRAN and contains the data-sets required for the book.\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;ISLR\u0026#34;) Thus, we can now read it in as library(\u0026quot;ISLR\u0026quot;)\nThe remaining sections are meant to be executed, and are marked as such, with r in {}.\n\u0026copy;\nWe will load the dataset once for the whole document.\nlibrary(\u0026#34;ISLR\u0026#34;)  Usage of the summary() function   summary(ISLR::College)## Private Apps Accept Enroll Top10perc ## No :212 Min. : 81 Min. : 72 Min. : 35 Min. : 1.00 ## Yes:565 1st Qu.: 776 1st Qu.: 604 1st Qu.: 242 1st Qu.:15.00 ## Median : 1558 Median : 1110 Median : 434 Median :23.00 ## Mean : 3002 Mean : 2019 Mean : 780 Mean :27.56 ## 3rd Qu.: 3624 3rd Qu.: 2424 3rd Qu.: 902 3rd Qu.:35.00 ## Max. :48094 Max. :26330 Max. :6392 Max. :96.00 ## Top25perc F.Undergrad P.Undergrad Outstate ## Min. : 9.0 Min. : 139 Min. : 1.0 Min. : 2340 ## 1st Qu.: 41.0 1st Qu.: 992 1st Qu.: 95.0 1st Qu.: 7320 ## Median : 54.0 Median : 1707 Median : 353.0 Median : 9990 ## Mean : 55.8 Mean : 3700 Mean : 855.3 Mean :10441 ## 3rd Qu.: 69.0 3rd Qu.: 4005 3rd Qu.: 967.0 3rd Qu.:12925 ## Max. :100.0 Max. :31643 Max. :21836.0 Max. :21700 ## Room.Board Books Personal PhD ## Min. :1780 Min. : 96.0 Min. : 250 Min. : 8.00 ## 1st Qu.:3597 1st Qu.: 470.0 1st Qu.: 850 1st Qu.: 62.00 ## Median :4200 Median : 500.0 Median :1200 Median : 75.00 ## Mean :4358 Mean : 549.4 Mean :1341 Mean : 72.66 ## 3rd Qu.:5050 3rd Qu.: 600.0 3rd Qu.:1700 3rd Qu.: 85.00 ## Max. :8124 Max. :2340.0 Max. :6800 Max. :103.00 ## Terminal S.F.Ratio perc.alumni Expend ## Min. : 24.0 Min. : 2.50 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 3186 ## 1st Qu.: 71.0 1st Qu.:11.50 1st Qu.:13.00 1st Qu.: 6751 ## Median : 82.0 Median :13.60 Median :21.00 Median : 8377 ## Mean : 79.7 Mean :14.09 Mean :22.74 Mean : 9660 ## 3rd Qu.: 92.0 3rd Qu.:16.50 3rd Qu.:31.00 3rd Qu.:10830 ## Max. :100.0 Max. :39.80 Max. :64.00 Max. :56233 ## Grad.Rate ## Min. : 10.00 ## 1st Qu.: 53.00 ## Median : 65.00 ## Mean : 65.46 ## 3rd Qu.: 78.00 ## Max. :118.00  Usage of pairs()   tenColl \u0026lt;- ISLR::College[,1:10] # For getting the first ten columns pairs(tenColl) # Scatterplot   Figure 1: Pairs\n   Boxplot creation with plot()   plot(ISLR::College$Private,ISLR::College$Outstate,xlab=\u0026#34;Private\u0026#34;,ylab=\u0026#34;Outstate\u0026#34;)   Figure 2: Boxplots\n   Binning and plotting   college=ISLR::College Elite=rep(\u0026#34;No\u0026#34;,nrow(college)) Elite[college$Top10perc\u0026gt;50]=\u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34; Elite=as.factor(Elite) college\u0026lt;-data.frame(college,Elite) summary(college$Elite)## No Yes ## 699 78plot(college$Outstate,college$Elite,xlab=\u0026#34;Outstate\u0026#34;,ylab=\u0026#34;Elite\u0026#34;)   Figure 3: Plotting Outstate and Elite\n   Histograms with hist()   par(mfrow=c(2,2)) hist(college$Enroll) hist(college$perc.alumni, col=2) hist(college$Personal, col=3, breaks=10) hist(college$PhD, breaks=10)   Figure 4: Histogram\n  hist(college$Top10perc, col=\u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;) hist(college$Outstate, col=23)   Figure 5: Colored Histogram\n   Explorations (graphical)  \\(0\\) implies the faculty have PhDs.

Make sure that the missing values have been removed from the data.\n(a) Which of the predictors are quantitative, and which are qualitative?\n(b) What is the range of each quantitative predictor? You can answer this using the range() function.\n\u0026copy; What is the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative predictor?\n(d) Now remove the 10th through 85th observations. What is the range, mean, and standard deviation of each predictor in the subset of the data that remains?\n(e) Using the full data set, investigate the predictors graphically, using scatterplots or other tools of your choice. Create some plots highlighting the relationships among the predictors. Comment on your findings.\n(f) Suppose that we wish to predict gas mileage (mpg) on the basis of the other variables. Do your plots suggest that any of the other variables might be useful in predicting mpg? Justify your answer.\nAnswer Once again, since the dataset is loaded from the library, we will simply start manipulating it.\n# Clean data autoDat\u0026lt;-na.omit(ISLR::Auto) # renamed for convenience (a) To determine weather the variables a qualitative or quantitative we can either inspect the variables by eye, or query the dataset.\nsummary(autoDat) # Observe the output for variance## mpg cylinders displacement horsepower weight ## Min. : 9.00 Min. :3.000 Min. : 68.0 Min. : 46.0 Min. :1613 ## 1st Qu.:17.00 1st Qu.:4.000 1st Qu.:105.0 1st Qu.: 75.0 1st Qu.:2225 ## Median :22.75 Median :4.000 Median :151.0 Median : 93.5 Median :2804 ## Mean :23.45 Mean :5.472 Mean :194.4 Mean :104.5 Mean :2978 ## 3rd Qu.:29.00 3rd Qu.:8.000 3rd Qu.:275.8 3rd Qu.:126.0 3rd Qu.:3615 ## Max. :46.60 Max. :8.000 Max. :455.0 Max. :230.0 Max. :5140 ## ## acceleration year origin name ## Min. : 8.00 Min. :70.00 Min. :1.000 amc matador : 5 ## 1st Qu.:13.78 1st Qu.:73.00 1st Qu.:1.000 ford pinto : 5 ## Median :15.50 Median :76.00 Median :1.000 toyota corolla : 5 ## Mean :15.54 Mean :75.98 Mean :1.577 amc gremlin : 4 ## 3rd Qu.:17.02 3rd Qu.:79.00 3rd Qu.:2.000 amc hornet : 4 ## Max. :24.80 Max. :82.00 Max. :3.000 chevrolet chevette: 4 ## (Other) :365str(autoDat) # Directly find find out## \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 392 obs. of 9 variables: ## $ mpg : num 18 15 18 16 17 15 14 14 14 15 ... ## $ cylinders : num 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 ... ## $ displacement: num 307 350 318 304 302 429 454 440 455 390 ... ## $ horsepower : num 130 165 150 150 140 198 220 215 225 190 ... ## $ weight : num 3504 3693 3436 3433 3449 ... ## $ acceleration: num 12 11.5 11 12 10.5 10 9 8.5 10 8.5 ... ## $ year : num 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 ... ## $ origin : num 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ name : Factor w/ 304 levels \u0026#34;amc ambassador brougham\u0026#34;,..: 49 36 231 14 161 141 54 223 241 2 ...

However, it is clear from the summary, that there is no statistical significance of year when used to fit a single parameter linear model. We note that when we compare this to the multiple linear regression analysis, we see that the year factor accounts for \\(0.7508\\) of the total, that is, the cars become more efficient every year\n  (d) Lets plot these\npar(mfrow=c(2,2)) noFactors %\u0026gt;% lm(mpg~horsepower,data=.) %\u0026gt;% plot(main=\u0026#34;Mileage v/s Horsepower\u0026#34;)   noFactors %\u0026gt;% lm(mpg~weight,data=.) %\u0026gt;% plot(main=\u0026#34;Mileage v/s Weight\u0026#34;)   noFactors %\u0026gt;% lm(mpg~year,data=.) %\u0026gt;% plot(main=\u0026#34;Mileage v/s Year\u0026#34;)   noFactors %\u0026gt;% lm(mpg~acceleration,data=.) %\u0026gt;% plot(main=\u0026#34;Mileage v/s Acceleration\u0026#34;)   noFactors %\u0026gt;% lm(mpg~displacement,data=.) %\u0026gt;% plot(main=\u0026#34;Mileage v/s Displacement\u0026#34;)   noFactors %\u0026gt;% lm(mpg~.,data=.) %\u0026gt;% plot(main=\u0026#34;Mileage Multiple Regression\u0026#34;)   Form this we can see that the fit is not very accurate as there is a clear curve to the residuals. The 14th point has high leverage, though it is of a small magnitude. Thus it is not expected to have affected the plot too much.\nWe know that an observation with a studentized residual greater than \\(3\\) in absolute value are possible outliers. Hence we must plot this.\n# Predict and get the plot fitPlot \u0026lt;- noFactors %\u0026gt;% lm(mpg~.,data=.) # See residuals plot(xlab=\u0026#34;Prediction\u0026#34;,ylab=\u0026#34;Studentized Residual\u0026#34;,x=predict(fitPlot),y=rstudent(fitPlot))   # Try a linear fit of studentized residuals par(mfrow=c(2,2)) plot(lm(predict(fitPlot)~rstudent(fitPlot)))   Clearly the studentized residuals are nonlinear w.r.t the prediction. Also, some points are above the absolute value of \\(3\\) so they might be outliers, in keeping with the leverage plot.\n(e) Interaction effects\nWe recall that x*y corresponds to x+y+x:y\n# View the correlation matrix cleanAuto %\u0026gt;% select(-name,-origin) %\u0026gt;% cor## mpg cylinders displacement horsepower weight ## mpg 1.0000000 -0.7776175 -0.8051269 -0.7784268 -0.8322442 ## cylinders -0.7776175 1.0000000 0.9508233 0.8429834 0.8975273 ## displacement -0.8051269 0.9508233 1.0000000 0.8972570 0.9329944 ## horsepower -0.7784268 0.8429834 0.8972570 1.0000000 0.8645377 ## weight -0.8322442 0.8975273 0.9329944 0.8645377 1.0000000 ## acceleration 0.4233285 -0.5046834 -0.5438005 -0.6891955 -0.4168392 ## year 0.5805410 -0.3456474 -0.3698552 -0.4163615 -0.3091199 ## acceleration year ## mpg 0.4233285 0.5805410 ## cylinders -0.5046834 -0.3456474 ## displacement -0.5438005 -0.3698552 ## horsepower -0.6891955 -0.4163615 ## weight -0.4168392 -0.3091199 ## acceleration 1.0000000 0.2903161 ## year 0.2903161 1.0000000summary(lm(mpg~weight*displacement*year,data=noFactors[(10:85),]))## ## Call: ## lm(formula = mpg ~ weight * displacement * year, data = noFactors[(10:85), ## ]) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -5.3020 -0.9055 0.0966 0.8912 3.7049 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

This means that I would like to continue with the simpler model, since the increase in R squared is too small to account for dealing with the additional factors.\n We see immediately, that there is a positive correlation only with being in the US Increases in price and being in an urban area actually decrease the sales, which is not surprising since being in the an urban area is probably correlated to a higher price, which we can check immediately   summary(lm(Price~Urban,data=cleanCarSeats))## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Price ~ Urban, data = cleanCarSeats) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -92.514 -15.514 1.205 14.595 74.486 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Being in an urban area has a low t-statistic for a positive increase on the slope\n Returning to our previous model, we note that there is a high value of the p-value of the t-statistic for Urban being true, this means there isn\u0026rsquo;t a real relationship between being in an urban area and the sales. This makes intuitive sense as well  note t-test is essentially a linear model with one variable, that is, if we want to find out if there is a relation between having a store in an urban area, we could sum all the urban yes and divide by the number of observations and compare that to the sum of all the urban no divided by the number of observations which is essentially the t-test again.\n Price is significant, and has an inverse relation with the sales, so we should keep that in mind  \u0026copy; In Equation Form:\n\\[ Sales=1.200573*USYes - 0.054459*Price - 0.021916*UrbanYes + 13.043469 \\]\n(e) Other models\n We know from our case-study on testing the full multiple linear regression for Sales that there are definitely more important variables being ignored.
