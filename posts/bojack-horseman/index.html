<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>For a while I was worried about writing about a TV show here. I thought it might
be frivolous, or worse, might outweigh the other kinds of articles I would like
to write. However, like most things, that which is ignored just grows, so it is
easier to just write and forget about it.</p>

<h2 id="the-show">The Show</h2>

<p>Much has been said about how Bojack Horseman is one of the best shows ever, and
they&rsquo;re all correct. For that matter I won&rsquo;t be going into the details of how
every episode ties together a tapestry of lives in a meaningful way, or any of
that. The show was amazingly poignant. The characters felt real. Which actually
leads me to the real issue.</p>

<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>

<p>The end of Bojack was <strong>good</strong>. It was the way it was meant to be. For a
slice-of-life show, it is a natural conclusion. It isn&rsquo;t necessary that any
catharsis occurs or that the characters change or become better or all that
jazz. It isn&rsquo;t about giving the viewers closure. It is simply about a window
onto the lives of (fictional) characters being shut. To that end, I disliked
attempts to bring closure in the show itself.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons why I felt strongly enough to write this, is simply
because when I looked around, the prevailing opinion was that the main character
should have been killed off, <span class="underline">for his sins</span>. This strikes me as a very flippant
attitude to take. It reeks of people trying to make the show a cautionary tale,
which is frankly speaking a weird approach to take towards any fictional story.
The idea that the character should be redeemed also seemed equally weak, for
much the same reasons.</p>

<p>The fact that the characters are hypocrites, and that none of them are as good
or bad as they make themselves out to be is one of the best parts of the show.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s actually all I have to say about this. I thought of adding relevant memes
or listing episodes or name dropping sites, but this isn&rsquo;t buzzfeed. The show is
incredible, and there are far better ways of proving that. Bust out your
favorite search engine + streaming content provider / digital piracy eye-patch
and give it a whirl. The only thing I&rsquo;d suggest is watching everything in order,
it&rsquo;s just that kind of show.</p>
