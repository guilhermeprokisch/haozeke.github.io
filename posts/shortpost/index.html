<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Sometime this year, I realized that I no longer have access to a lot of my older
communication. This included, a lot of resources I enjoyed and shared with the
people who were around me at that point in time. To counter this, I have decided
to opt for shorter posts, even if they don&rsquo;t always include the same level of
detail I would prefer to provide.</p>

<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>

<ul>
<li>I have an automated system based around IFTTT combined with Twitter, Diigo,
and even Pocket</li>
<li>However, that doesn&rsquo;t really tell me much, and trawling through a massive glut
of data is often pointless as well</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s always Twitter, but I don&rsquo;t really care to hear the views of others
when I want to revisit my own ideas</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
<li>I will be making shorter posts here, like the random one on <a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/" target="_blank">octobox</a></li>
