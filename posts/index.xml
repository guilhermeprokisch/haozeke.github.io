      <title>CS106A Small Group Training</title>

      <description>Background As I mentioned earlier, I&amp;rsquo;m leading a section for Stanford CS106A: Code in Place. This post relates to the notes and thoughts garnered during the small group training session&amp;nbsp;1.
Reflections Demographics Redacted. Did not use breakout meetings due to privacy issues.
Engagement and Participation  Some people were more active (skewed responses) Some of the more rudimentary questions might have been suppressed  Highlighted Moments  Covering multiple perspectives Different mental models  Challenges and Transformations  Technical debt was an issue Lack of engagement Went on for too long  For me in particular:</description>

      <title>CS106A Section Meeting I</title>

      <description>Background As I mentioned earlier, I&amp;rsquo;m leading a section for Stanford CS106A: Code in Place. I did also mention I&amp;rsquo;d try to keep a set of short notes on the process. I finally had my first section meeting!
Preparation I went through the following:
 Sent out a welcome message Detailed the workflow Set up a HackMD instance Set up some slides in beamer&amp;nbsp;1  However, after that, I was still concerned since I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much of a response on the ice-breakers for EdStem.</description>

      <title>Small Section On-boarding</title>

      <description>Background As I mentioned in my last post, I&amp;rsquo;m leading a section for Stanford CS106A: Code in Place. I did also mention I&amp;rsquo;d try to keep a set of short notes on the process. So there1.
The Training Given the overwhelming number of students, and section leaders, the small groups are for fostering a community of teachers.
Consider allowing for daisy chaining during introductions Discussions are the primary take-away Only the instructor should be coding during the session  Core components  Clarity Content Atmosphere Section management Correctness  Sectional Details  Check in at the start Notice the space Check in regularly Avoid negative phrases Establish norms and the general culture  Zoom Norms  Have people introduce themselves Mute people when they aren&amp;rsquo;t talking Raise hands Try to use icebreakers which respect privacy  Materials Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the stuff which, being as it was open-sourced, I suppose is OK to put here2.</description>

      <title>On-boarding for Code in Place</title>

      <description>Background A few weeks ago, I ended up recording a video for the Stanford CS106A: Code in Place initiative (which can be found here). I heard back a while ago, and am now to lead a section for the course!
I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be making a series of short posts as this process continues.
On-Boarding This was very reminiscent of the Carpentries instructor training, which makes sense, given how well thought out that experience was.</description>

      <title>Analytics: Google to Goat</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</link>

      <description>Background Like a lot of my tech based rants, this was brought on by a recent Hacker News post. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why the product listed there is a hollow faux FOSS rip-off. I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss how that &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; analytics option, like many others are just hobby projects taking pot shots at other projects. Or how insanely overpriced most alternatives are.
I will however discuss why and how I transitioned to using the awesome Goat Counter.</description>

      <title>Trees and Bags</title>

      <description>Explain why using bagging for prediction trees generally improves predictions over regular prediction trees.
 Introduction Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregation) is one of the most commonly used ensemble method for improving the prediction of trees. We will broadly follow a historical development trend to understand the process. That is, we will begin by considering the Bootstrap method. This in turn requires knowledge of the Jacknife method, which is understandable from a simple bias variance perspective.</description>

      <title>Everyone Should Get an A - David MacKay</title>

      <description>Background  I recently read this post written by the now deceased Prof. David MacKay&amp;nbsp;1 It should be read widely, however, given that it is distributed as a ps.gz which is then a .ps file, and thus probably inaccessible to many of the people who should read it, I decided to rework it for native online consumption (there is also a pdf) THIS IS NOT MY CONTENT&amp;nbsp;2 Now, enjoy the post  Everyone Should Get an A Imagine a University – call it Camwick – where all students arrive with straight A grades.</description>

      <title>D3 for Git</title>

      <description>Background  I have had a lot of discussions regarding the teaching of git This is mostly as a part of the SoftwareCarpentries, or in view of my involvement with univ.ai, or simply in every public space I am associated with Without getting into my views, I just wanted to keep this resource in mind  The site  Learning git is a highly contentious thing People seem to be fond of GUI tools, especially since on non *nix systems, it seems that there is a lot of debate surrounding obtaining the git utility in the first place  One of the best ways of understanding (without installing stuff) the mental models required for working with git is this site</description>

      <title>Shorter Posts</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</link>

      <description> Background Sometime this year, I realized that I no longer have access to a lot of my older communication. This included, a lot of resources I enjoyed and shared with the people who were around me at that point in time. To counter this, I have decided to opt for shorter posts, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t always include the same level of detail I would prefer to provide.
Alternatives  I have an automated system based around IFTTT combined with Twitter, Diigo, and even Pocket However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really tell me much, and trawling through a massive glut of data is often pointless as well There&amp;rsquo;s always Twitter, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care to hear the views of others when I want to revisit my own ideas  Conclusions  I will be making shorter posts here, like the random one on octobox  </description>

      <title>Provisioning Dotfiles on an HPC</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</guid>
      <description>Background My dotfiles turned 4 years old a few months ago (since 9th Jan 2017) and remains one of my most frequently updated projects for obvious reasons. Going through the changes reminds me of a whole of posts I never got around to writing.
Anyway, recently I gained access to another HPC cluster, with a standard configuration (bash, old CentOS) and decided to track my provisioning steps. This is really a very streamlined experience by now, since I&amp;rsquo;ve used the same setup across scores of machines.</description>
