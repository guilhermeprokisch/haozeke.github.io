      <title>Refactoring Dotfiles For Colemak</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/colemak-dots-refactor/</link>

      <description>Background I have, in the past written about how I made the switch to Colemak. However, until recently, I was still trying to mimic the VIM keybindings from QWERTY. This is a post where I discuss the changes I made to ensure that I never have to stretch my fingers in odd ways again. The main idea is expressed well by vim-colemak.
Colemak layout: | QWERTY layout: `12345 67890-= Move around: | (instead of) `12345 67890-= qwfpg jluy;[]\  e | k qwert yuiop[]\  arstd HNEIo&amp;#39; h i | h l asdfg HJKL;&amp;#39; zxcvb km,.</description>

      <title>Pandoc to Orgmode with Babel</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-pandoc-babel/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-pandoc-babel/</guid>
      <description>Background One of the best things about writing in orgmode is that we can embed and execute arbitrary code snippets. However, not all languages have an exporter, for obvious reasons. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no way to call pandoc on embedded snippets, which feels like a waste, especially when a whole bunch of documentation formats can be converted to orgmode with it.
Consider the following beautifully highlighted snippet of an rst (ReStructured Text) list table.</description>

      <title>Using Mathematica with Orgmode</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-mathematica/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-mathematica/</guid>
      <description>Background I have been wanting to find a workflow which allows me to bypass writing a lot of TeX by hand for a while now. To that end I looked into using a computer algebra system (CAS). Naturally, my first choice was the FOSS Maxima (also because it uses Lisp under the hood). However, for all the reasons listed here, relating to its accuracy, which have not been fixed even though the post was over 5 years ago, I ended up having to go with the closed source Mathematica.</description>

      <title>Analytics: Google to Goat</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</guid>
      <description>Background Like a lot of my tech based rants, this was brought on by a recent Hacker News post. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why the product listed there is a hollow faux FOSS rip-off. I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss how that &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; analytics option, like many others are just hobby projects taking pot shots at other projects. Or how insanely overpriced most alternatives are.
I will however discuss why and how I transitioned to using the awesome Goat Counter.</description>

      <title>D3 for Git</title>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/d3git/</guid>
      <description>Background  I have had a lot of discussions regarding the teaching of git This is mostly as a part of the SoftwareCarpentries, or in view of my involvement with univ.ai, or simply in every public space I am associated with Without getting into my views, I just wanted to keep this resource in mind  The site  Learning git is a highly contentious thing People seem to be fond of GUI tools, especially since on non *nix systems, it seems that there is a lot of debate surrounding obtaining the git utility in the first place  One of the best ways of understanding (without installing stuff) the mental models required for working with git is this site</description>

      <title>Shorter Posts</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</guid>
      <description> Background Sometime this year, I realized that I no longer have access to a lot of my older communication. This included, a lot of resources I enjoyed and shared with the people who were around me at that point in time. To counter this, I have decided to opt for shorter posts, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t always include the same level of detail I would prefer to provide.
Alternatives  I have an automated system based around IFTTT combined with Twitter, Diigo, and even Pocket However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really tell me much, and trawling through a massive glut of data is often pointless as well There&amp;rsquo;s always Twitter, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care to hear the views of others when I want to revisit my own ideas  Conclusions  I will be making shorter posts here, like the random one on octobox  </description>

      <title>Provisioning Dotfiles on an HPC</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</guid>
      <description>Background My dotfiles turned 4 years old a few months ago (since 9th Jan 2017) and remains one of my most frequently updated projects for obvious reasons. Going through the changes reminds me of a whole of posts I never got around to writing.
Anyway, recently I gained access to another HPC cluster, with a standard configuration (bash, old CentOS) and decided to track my provisioning steps. This is really a very streamlined experience by now, since I&amp;rsquo;ve used the same setup across scores of machines.</description>

      <title>Switching to Colemak</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/colemak-switch/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/colemak-switch/</guid>
      <description>Background I just realized that it has been over two years since I switched from QWERTY to Colemak but somehow never managed to write about it. It was a major change in my life, and it took forever to get acclimatized to. I do not think I&amp;rsquo;ll ever again be in a position to make such a change in my life again, but it was definitely worth it.
Touch Typing My interest in touch typing in I decided to digitize my notes for posterity, during the last two years of my undergraduate studies back in Harcourt Butler Technical Institute (HBTI) Kanpur, India.</description>

      <title>Pandora and Proxychains</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pandora-proxychains/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pandora-proxychains/</guid>
      <description>Background  Pandora doesn&amp;rsquo;t work outside the states I keep forgetting how to set-up proxychains  Proxychains Technically this article expects proxychains-ng, which seems to be the more up-to-date fork of the original proxychains.
 Install proxychains-ng
# I am on archlinux.. sudo pacman -S proxychains-ng Copy the configuration to the $HOME directory
cp /etc/proxychains.conf . Edit said configuration to add some US-based proxy
  In my particular case, I don&amp;rsquo;t keep the tor section enabled.</description>

      <title>Replacing Jupyter with Orgmode</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode/</guid>
      <description>Background  I dislike Jupyter notebooks (and JupyterHub) a lot EIN is really not much of a solution either  In the past I have written some posts on TeX with JupyterHub and discussed ways to use virtual Python with JupyterHub in a more reasonable manner.
However, I personally found that EIN was a huge pain to work with, and I mostly ended up working with the web-interface anyway.</description>

      <title>Poetry and Direnv</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/poetry-direnv/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/poetry-direnv/</guid>
      <description>Background  I end up writing about using poetry a lot I almost always use direnv in real life too I don&amp;rsquo;t keep writing mini scripts in my .envrc  Honestly there&amp;rsquo;s nothing here anyone using the direnv wiki will find surprising, but then it is still neat to link back to.
Setting Up Poetry This essentially works by simply modifying the global .direnvrc which essentially gets sourced by every local .</description>

      <title>Taming Github Notifications</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/</guid>
      <description>Background As a member of several large organizations, I get a lot of github notifications. Not all of these are of relevance to me. This is especially true of psuedo-monorepo style repositories like the JOSS review system and especially the exercism community.
 I recently (re-)joined the exercism community as a maintainer for the C++ lessons after having been a (sporadic) teacher This was largely in response to a community call to action as the group needed new blood to usher in v3 of the exercism project  Anyway, I have since found that at the small cost of possibly much of my public repo data, I can manage my notifications better with Octobox</description>
