      <title>Pandoc to Orgmode with Babel</title>

      <description>Background One of the best things about writing in orgmode is that we can embed and execute arbitrary code snippets. However, not all languages have an exporter, for obvious reasons. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no way to call pandoc on embedded snippets, which feels like a waste, especially when a whole bunch of documentation formats can be converted to orgmode with it.
Consider the following beautifully highlighted snippet of an rst (ReStructured Text) list table.</description>

      <title>Using Mathematica with Orgmode</title>

      <description>Background I have been wanting to find a workflow which allows me to bypass writing a lot of TeX by hand for a while now. To that end I looked into using a computer algebra system (CAS). Naturally, my first choice was the FOSS Maxima (also because it uses Lisp under the hood). However, for all the reasons listed here, relating to its accuracy, which have not been fixed even though the post was over 5 years ago, I ended up having to go with the closed source Mathematica.</description>

      <title>Replacing Jupyter with Orgmode</title>

      <description>Background  I dislike Jupyter notebooks (and JupyterHub) a lot EIN is really not much of a solution either  In the past I have written some posts on TeX with JupyterHub and discussed ways to use virtual Python with JupyterHub in a more reasonable manner.
However, I personally found that EIN was a huge pain to work with, and I mostly ended up working with the web-interface anyway.</description>
