      <title>Pandora and Proxychains</title>

      <description>Background  Pandora doesn&amp;rsquo;t work outside the states I keep forgetting how to set-up proxychains  Proxychains Technically this article expects proxychains-ng, which seems to be the more up-to-date fork of the original proxychains.
 Install proxychains-ng
# I am on archlinux.. sudo pacman -S proxychains-ng Copy the configuration to the $HOME directory
cp /etc/proxychains.conf . Edit said configuration to add some US-based proxy
  In my particular case, I don&amp;rsquo;t keep the tor section enabled.</description>

      <title>Replacing Jupyter with Orgmode</title>

      <description>Background  I dislike Jupyter notebooks (and JupyterHub) a lot EIN is really not much of a solution either  In the past I have written some posts on TeX with JupyterHub and discussed ways to use virtual Python with JupyterHub in a more reasonable manner.
However, I personally found that EIN was a huge pain to work with, and I mostly ended up working with the web-interface anyway.</description>

      <description>Background  I end up writing about using poetry a lot I almost always use direnv in real life too I don&amp;rsquo;t keep writing mini scripts in my .envrc  Honestly there&amp;rsquo;s nothing here anyone using the direnv wiki will find surprising, but then it is still neat to link back to.
Setting Up Poetry This essentially works by simply modifying the global .direnvrc which essentially gets sourced by every local .</description>

      <title>Taming Github Notifications</title>

      <description>Background As a member of several large organizations, I get a lot of github notifications. Not all of these are of relevance to me. This is especially true of psuedo-monorepo style repositories like the JOSS review system and especially the exercism community.
 I recently (re-)joined the exercism community as a maintainer for the C++ lessons after having been a (sporadic) teacher This was largely in response to a community call to action as the group needed new blood to usher in v3 of the exercism project  Anyway, I have since found that at the small cost of possibly much of my public repo data, I can manage my notifications better with Octobox</description>
