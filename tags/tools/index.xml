      <description>A short post on my current set-up for R with nixpkgs and emacs to auto-compile my system configuration.
 Background This is my third post on working with nixpkgs and R.
 Part I covered ways of working effectively with R and nixpkgs Part II dealt with composing dependent devtools packages in a per-package environment, with a focus on rethinking and tidybayes.rethinking  This final part is about automating the system-wide configuration using emacs.</description>

      <title>Statistical Rethinking and Nix</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rethinking-r-nix/</link>

      <description>This post describes how to set up a transparent automated setup for reproducible R workflows using nixpkgs, niv, and lorri. The explanatory example used throughout the post is one of setting up the rethinking package and running some examples from the excellent second edition of &amp;ldquo;Statistical Rethinking&amp;rdquo; by Richard McElreath.
 Background As detailed in an earlier post1, I had set up Nix to work with non-CRAN packages. If the rest of this section is unclear, please refer back to the earlier post.</description>

      <title>Nix with R and devtools</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-r-devtools/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/nix-r-devtools/</guid>
      <description>This post discusses briefly, the nix-shell environment for reproducible programming. In particular, there is an emphasis on extensions for installing and working with packages not in CRAN, i.e. packages off Github which are normally installed with devtools.
 Background The entire nix ecosystem is fantastic, and is the main packaging system used by d-SEAMS as well. Recently I began working through the excellent second edition of &amp;ldquo;Statistical Rethinking&amp;rdquo; by Richard McElreath1.</description>

      <title>LosslessCut, Zoom and an AMA for CS106A</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/losslesscut-zoom-ama/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/losslesscut-zoom-ama/</guid>
      <description>Background I recently had the opportunity to take part in an AMA (ask me anything) session for the CS106A students on Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences. This is a post about the technical issues, and also includes a video if you read through.
Zoom and LosslessCut Zoom recordings are one of the nicer ways to deal with switching windows and screen sharing, especially after fixing the dark screen glitch.</description>

      <description>Background I have been leading the fantastic section 881 as a virtual section leader for the Stanford CS106A: Code in Place initiative for the past four weeks. I have also spent a lot of time on Zoom, sharing my screen. Fun fact. My screen shares look like this:
  Figure 1: Zoom screen share with weird overlay
  This post is about hunting down what caused this amazing zoom glitch1 and how I finally fixed it.</description>

      <title>Pandoc to Orgmode with Babel</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-pandoc-babel/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 16:39:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-pandoc-babel/</guid>
      <description>Background One of the best things about writing in orgmode is that we can embed and execute arbitrary code snippets. However, not all languages have an exporter, for obvious reasons. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no way to call pandoc on embedded snippets, which feels like a waste, especially when a whole bunch of documentation formats can be converted to orgmode with it.
Consider the following beautifully highlighted snippet of an rst (ReStructured Text) list table.</description>

      <title>Using Mathematica with Orgmode</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-mathematica/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-mathematica/</guid>
      <description>Background I have been wanting to find a workflow which allows me to bypass writing a lot of TeX by hand for a while now. To that end I looked into using a computer algebra system (CAS). Naturally, my first choice was the FOSS Maxima (also because it uses Lisp under the hood). However, for all the reasons listed here, relating to its accuracy, which have not been fixed even though the post was over 5 years ago, I ended up having to go with the closed source Mathematica.</description>

      <title>Analytics: Google to Goat</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</guid>
      <description>Background Like a lot of my tech based rants, this was brought on by a recent Hacker News post. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why the product listed there is a hollow faux FOSS rip-off. I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss how that &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; analytics option, like many others are just hobby projects taking pot shots at other projects. Or how insanely overpriced most alternatives are.
I will however discuss why and how I transitioned to using the awesome Goat Counter.</description>

      <title>D3 for Git</title>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/d3git/</guid>
      <description>Background  I have had a lot of discussions regarding the teaching of git This is mostly as a part of the SoftwareCarpentries, or in view of my involvement with univ.ai, or simply in every public space I am associated with Without getting into my views, I just wanted to keep this resource in mind  The site  Learning git is a highly contentious thing People seem to be fond of GUI tools, especially since on non *nix systems, it seems that there is a lot of debate surrounding obtaining the git utility in the first place  One of the best ways of understanding (without installing stuff) the mental models required for working with git is this site</description>

      <title>Shorter Posts</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</guid>
      <description> Background Sometime this year, I realized that I no longer have access to a lot of my older communication. This included, a lot of resources I enjoyed and shared with the people who were around me at that point in time. To counter this, I have decided to opt for shorter posts, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t always include the same level of detail I would prefer to provide.
Alternatives  I have an automated system based around IFTTT combined with Twitter, Diigo, and even Pocket However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really tell me much, and trawling through a massive glut of data is often pointless as well There&amp;rsquo;s always Twitter, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care to hear the views of others when I want to revisit my own ideas  Conclusions  I will be making shorter posts here, like the random one on octobox  </description>

      <title>Pandora and Proxychains</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pandora-proxychains/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 05:28:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pandora-proxychains/</guid>
      <description>Background  Pandora doesn&amp;rsquo;t work outside the states I keep forgetting how to set-up proxychains  Proxychains Technically this article expects proxychains-ng, which seems to be the more up-to-date fork of the original proxychains.
 Install proxychains-ng
# I am on archlinux.. sudo pacman -S proxychains-ng Copy the configuration to the $HOME directory
cp /etc/proxychains.conf . Edit said configuration to add some US-based proxy
  In my particular case, I don&amp;rsquo;t keep the tor section enabled.</description>

      <title>Replacing Jupyter with Orgmode</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode/</guid>
      <description>Background  I dislike Jupyter notebooks (and JupyterHub) a lot EIN is really not much of a solution either  In the past I have written some posts on TeX with JupyterHub and discussed ways to use virtual Python with JupyterHub in a more reasonable manner.
However, I personally found that EIN was a huge pain to work with, and I mostly ended up working with the web-interface anyway.</description>

      <title>Poetry and Direnv</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/poetry-direnv/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/poetry-direnv/</guid>
      <description>Background  I end up writing about using poetry a lot I almost always use direnv in real life too I don&amp;rsquo;t keep writing mini scripts in my .envrc  Honestly there&amp;rsquo;s nothing here anyone using the direnv wiki will find surprising, but then it is still neat to link back to.
Setting Up Poetry This essentially works by simply modifying the global .direnvrc which essentially gets sourced by every local .</description>

      <title>Taming Github Notifications</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/</link>

      <guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/</guid>
      <description>Background As a member of several large organizations, I get a lot of github notifications. Not all of these are of relevance to me. This is especially true of psuedo-monorepo style repositories like the JOSS review system and especially the exercism community.
 I recently (re-)joined the exercism community as a maintainer for the C++ lessons after having been a (sporadic) teacher This was largely in response to a community call to action as the group needed new blood to usher in v3 of the exercism project  Anyway, I have since found that at the small cost of possibly much of my public repo data, I can manage my notifications better with Octobox</description>
